            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Addreſs unto your Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the enſuing Example of the hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Impious, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from the mouth of a Sage, Learned and Devout Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the good <hi>Simplicius,</hi> one of the principal Perſons in the following Hiſtory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt acquainted with all
<pb facs="tcp:58555:3"/>the particulars of it.</p>
            <p>If miſchiefs are cured by their oppoſite remedies; if we ſave our ſelves by the contrary of that which deſtroys us, and if things are beſt ſet off by Compariſon with their contraries, I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not but the Splendor of your Name, and the Glory of your Virtue, will here ſhine with the greateſt luſtre amongſt the thick darkneſſes repreſented in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Narrative. But God who draweth light from the midſt of obſcurity, does give us good inſtructions, by the horrour ſo naturally ſtamped on the front of Vice. Some Criticks who
<pb facs="tcp:58555:3"/>ſhall run it over (as it often happens) without ſtopping at this Epiſtle, will preſently judge that theſe are matters as unſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my hand, as for your eyes, your Soul being as far remote from ſuch <hi>Idea's,</hi> as the Eaſt from the Weſt: But my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are different, as I ſuppoſe yours will be, unleſs you be an Enemy to your own advantage; for who are fitter to beat down the moſt enormous vices, than thoſe who are elevated to the higheſt pitch of Vertue? The oppoſing a Giant to <hi>David,</hi> was it not the means to aggrandize his Glory? What other rodbut
<pb facs="tcp:58555:4"/>that of <hi>Moſes</hi> could devour Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents? and what other ſtrength then that of <hi>Sampſon</hi> could tear a <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſubdue the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and unhinge and bear away the Gates of a City? 'tis for St. <hi>Peter</hi> to kill and eat unclean Beaſts. The generous <hi>Julus</hi> in the great <hi>Roman</hi> Poet disdained to hunt the fearful Game, or to imploy himſelf in chaſing or killing the timerous Deer; wild Boars and Bears are onely ſubjects worthy his purſuit. 'Tis the valour of an Enemy that raiſeth the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Victor. Your deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo full of Honour and of Virtue, make you ſo terrible to
<pb facs="tcp:58555:4"/>Vice, to ſuffer her to approach you otherwiſe then as ſubdued below your feet, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging you Victorious againſt her ſtrongeſt efforts. It is in this equipage that this relation does approach you; For as the Serpent <hi>Pithon</hi> was one of the moſt famous Trophies of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> who had pierced it with his Arrows, a fabulous inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby the Poets would denote that the rayes of the Sun do purifie all ordures; And as this Glorious planet does with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infection caſt his rays upon a dunghil; ſo thoſe of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can glance upon the crimes
<pb facs="tcp:58555:5"/>againſt which I declaim in the enſuing pages, without offence; and your Vertue ſhall ſerve me for a Lance and Buckler in my combat, and (I hope) my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, of theſe Monſters. The Ark which ſaved from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge the ſeed of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, did receive the unclean beaſt without contracting any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo a firm and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Soul looks down upon the inſolence of Vice with a disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye, and is ſo elevated as it were in the Higheſt regions of the Air, that their black vapours can never reach it: <hi>Judith</hi> offered to the Lord the
<pb facs="tcp:58555:5"/>Equipage of <hi>Holofernes, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi> accurſed things of <hi>Acan,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſacrificed to him the abominations of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> Theſe reaſons <hi>My Lord,</hi> have invited me to addreſs this Tragical Narrative to Your Lordſhip, as to a <hi>Hercules,</hi> the chaſer of miſchief; nor is this without Example, the ancient <hi>Ethnicks</hi> dedicated Wolves to <hi>Mars,</hi> Eagles to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Sol,</hi> Owls to <hi>Minerva,</hi> and Foxes to <hi>Mercury.</hi> And the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themſelves ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed Oxen and Goats to the great God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Lord of Hoſts: And to ſay truly, at

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58555:10"/>of Marqueſs, had two Sons beſides Daughters, and as it ordinarily happens in great Families, the Children are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſeveral Vocations before they have years enough to make them fit to be judged of to what they are moſt proper; the younger of a more ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and active temper than the elder, was by the deſignation of earthly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt more than ſound judgment, or a reaſonable examen, deſigned for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to ſuffer the Spiritual Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Evangelical Eunuchs, and to have <hi>Dina</hi> for his Hire, that is, to be maintained at the expences of the Daughter of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Sion</hi> the Church: Thus were our two Brethren born like <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his two dogs, upon one cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but deſtined to as different ways, and as far ſeparated as Earth from Heaven. Happy younger Brother, if he had continued in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi> portion! but it was afterwards ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him as much againſt his will as it was at firſt impoſed upon him. The Elder Brother was ſent to the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, there to learn the Exerciſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a Gentleman, that was to be bred to the Profeſſion of Arms, to which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58555:10"/>he was flexible enough, not that his diſpoſition (which was rather lumpiſh than active) was much inclined to ſo robuſt an imployment, which beſides a manly body required a ſtout and marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Soul; but having as pliable and docile a temper as was requiſite for a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Authority and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Parents, he rendered his will ſo agreeable to their deſires, that his chief ſtudy was Obedience. But as it is impoſſible for the endeavours of Art to vanquiſh the inclinations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to give a hard and impregnable temper to that which is compoſed of a brittle clay, inſtead of growing hardy and vigorous amongſt his exerciſes of Arms and Horſemanſhip, he daily grew more weak and unactive, ſo that to all appearance this Plant required a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation to ſome other ſoil, I mean to another more agreeable courſe of life: But that was a thing which he might rather deſire than hope for from his inflexible Parents, who more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him his Age than Inclination, his Elder Brotherhood more than his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temper and diſpoſition, forced his Genius to bend to what they deſired,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58555:11"/>conſtraining him to pitch upon a courſe of life, which he accorded to with ſuch reluctancy that it was more likely to ſhorten his days than to advance his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>

               <p>Our younger Brother, of a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Body and active Spirit, was by a violent reſtraint upon them both, put into an Academy more reſerved, more peaceable and more retired, which at firſt he could look upon no otherwiſe but as a Priſon, but was forced to bend his neck under the yoke of a Superior Authority; a yoke too ſtrong to be broken by the weakneſs of his tender years, in which his Parents had ſo great an aſcendant over his youthful affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: He was confined (as a ſacrifice to the Church and Muſes) to be educated amongſt a Seminary of Jeſuits: And as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58555:11"/>there is no yoke ſo hard, no burthen ſo heavy, but Cuſtom (which is another Nature) makes the one eaſie and the other light, time by continual and inſenſible drops hollowing by degrees the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Spirit, at length gained ſuch footing, that what was before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, now became voluntary, he making a Vertue of neceſſity, which is a harſh and imperious Miſtreſs: Like the Horſe, which at firſt being forced by traces to pace, is ready to fall at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep, but once having learnt what they are deſigned, they go as nimbly as if they had no reſtraint upon their legs; ſo the Gally-ſlave, when once accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bank and chain, the Oar which was before ſo inſupportable, is at laſt eaſily managed. So he by little and little tempered and moderated the boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and emotions of his haughty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and as the <hi>Italian</hi> ſpirits are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pliable to any form, and are like wax, ſuſceptible of any impreſſion, he ſo far moderated the contrariety of his Palate, that what was Phyſick before, now became Natural food; and being Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized there by his Tutors, which are the rareſt in the World to range unruly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58555:12"/>ſpirits to their terms of Duty, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of ſo ſweet, humble, modeſt and tractable a temper, ſo fitted for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Learning, to which he had the accompliſhment of an excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that all theſe added together ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him a youth of great expectation. His Reaſon too begun to come over to that Party, and aſſiſted the deſign, by forming theſe conſiderations in his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that his Parents better adviſed than himſelf, knew better the bent of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and that aſpiring to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Scarlet (a colour whoſe ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor does uſually dazzle the eyes of thoſe of that Nation) he might at laſt arrive to the higheſt Degree of Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, and make a <hi>plus ultra</hi> to the Pillars of <hi>Hercules;</hi> and that it would be far more advantageous to him to be a rich Beneficiary than a poor Gentleman; that his Brother by the tyranny of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, inheriting all the Eſtate of his Anceſtors, to keep up in him the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Family, there remained nought to him but <hi>Alexander</hi>'s portion, Hope: Finally, the bread of the Church ſeemed to him hearty and pleaſing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting his Palate with a Royal guſto.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58555:12"/>He was not deceived in his conceits, for his Parents ſeeing him take the bridle in his teeth, reſolving vigorouſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an accompliſhment in his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, did ſoon after obtain for him a Priory and Abby, beſides a rich Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; here ſee him in a high degree of opulency, and juſt upon the ſteps to further Preferment. The Religious of this great and holy Fraternity, under whoſe directions he ſucked in Learning with his Letters, ſeeing him deſtined by the determinations of his Parents to an Eccleſiaſtick Profeſſion, as well as by his own Inclinations, ſpared no care nor diligence for his inſtruction in Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as well as Morality, fitting for a ſubject whoſe later ſeaſon promiſed great fruits to the Church: For though theſe Devout and Learned Fathers have an Univerſal care without acceptation of Perſons, to water diligently the young Plants committed to their charge, yet both by their Pious Inclination and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Inſtitution, they have a nearer attention to thoſe who are more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly dedicated to the Service of the Altar, who muſt one day be the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58555:13"/>the pilled rods with which the great <hi>Jacob</hi> will imprint his colours upon the Lambs of his Sheep-fold: So that not contented to inſtill into their Souls an ordinary and common Piety, they bring them by more lofty and elevated paths to the top of an exemplary Devotion; making them oftner frequent Spiritual exerciſes, and the holy Sacrament the Spiritual food, which nouriſheth to a great growth in Vertue ſuch as feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: For them theſe holy Labourers in God's Vineyard have many other ways and holy induſtries, amongſt whom the Congregations devoted to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Servies,</hi> and under the eſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Bleſſed Virgin, hold a high Rank, for there the leaſt Devout are inſtigated to Devotion by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Piety of thoſe Profeſſors, and the deadeſt coals take fire at their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and flame with Celeſtial Love, in imitation of the great fervency that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears there: For there the works of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſhine the more bright, the ſecreter they are kept, and their Piety and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on all occaſions are ready with their flames to warm all that approach them. Our younger Brother remained
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58555:13"/>ſeven or eight years in this Seminary of Learning and Godlineſs, being every day more accompliſht than other, that it ſeemed he might juſtly ſay with <hi>David,</hi>

               <p>This young Plant daily grew and ſpread ſo faſt, that it gave great hope of proving at laſt a ſtately Tree, and one of the top branches of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> He became very expert in Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and skilful in the Mathematicks; the knowledge of Philoſophy had long ſince ſtrengthned and confirmed his Judgment, and having ſaluted the Queen of Sciences, and his principal Miſtreſs, Divinity, he had already been imployed ſix months in her ſervice amongſt an Eccleſiaſtick order, which by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution were to be preſent in their Habits at the Celebrating Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and known by the names of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors;</hi> to this he was obliged, for the large Revenues he received from the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58555:14"/>Church, where he had made himſelf ſufficiently known by publick diſputes in Philoſophy, and had reaped a great commendation by reading Divinity in the Congregation of our Lady. The Fathers of the Company took great joy in his Education, receiving infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that they had ſown their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in ſo good a ſoil: he ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from good to better, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of his ſpirit grew white towards a compleat Harveſt, when on a ſuddain an impetuous whirlwind, an unexpected tempeſt ſwept away the fruits of ſo grand an expectation. His Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had for a great while quitted the Academy, for to learn the Arts of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, Fencing and Dancing require not ſo long a ſtudy as the Sciences; he remained in his Fathers houſe as Heir apparent, and led a life honeſt and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt enough, but ſoft and tender and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate, according to the cuſtom of great Perſons, not only of that Nation but moſt others, as if idleneſs were an inheritance intailed upon Nobility. We have nothing to ſay of him, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing come to our knowledge pertinent to this Hiſtory, only this, that though
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58555:14"/>this Tree brought not much Fruit, yet its Leaves being ſhaken with the winds of but few Paſſions, made little noiſe; thus quietly ſlipt away the few years which he paſſed upon Earth, till at laſt he paid his tribute to the Tomb, not as the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the middle of his Courſe, but even in the firſt mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Orient, a lingring Fever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of this heavy Melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which in a ſhort time brought him quietly to his Grave: Some ſay that too violent exerciſe had ſhortned his days, and that if he had been deſtined to Letters and a repoſed life, he might have lived longer; but how vain is it to deſcant upon the Decrees of Divine Providence? our weak reaſons of that ſort being like ſoft wax before the Sun. Proceed ye Parents in this courſe, and found the total of your hopes upon your Eldeſt, but conſider how far different the deſigns of heaven are from terreſtrial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.</p>

               <p>To expreſs the regrets and ſorrows of his Parents, is a thing impoſſible; you may a little gueſs at them, by comparing them to thoſe of a laborious Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who after much toilſome labour, and weariſom expectation, ſees an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Tempeſt deſtroy all the Fruits of his labour and the means of his ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, juſt as it is ready to be reaped: for juſt as they were upon the deſign of placing richly and honourably in the World this Prop of their houſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory of their hopes, by matching him into a Family ſuitable to theirs in Wealth and Dignity, thereby to tranſmit their Name to poſterity, they ſee themſelves on a ſuddain deprived of that happineſs which they had ſo ardently deſired, ſo long expected, and ſo vainly hoped. But conſidering how vain it was to lament ſo irreparable a loſs, they began to turn their eyes from him that was now nought but duſt in the Grave, to the other who though alive was buried as to the World, thinking now to tranſplant the care of their Poſterity to that onely
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58555:15"/>remaining ſoil, as if they had lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Moſaical Law, where the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Brother ſhall raiſe up ſeed to the dead, to retrieve his Name and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the Tomb of oblivion. It is hard to tell you how the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received this news, for he found his ſoul ſo divided, and ſo moved on all ſides by ſeveral paſſions, that he needed a ſtrong clew of Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him out of that Labyrinth: He ſaw himſelf called to a large Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but having levelled his deſigns a quite contrary way, he was ill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to change his intentions, ſeeing himſelf ſo far advanced into that Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which he had at firſt ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as great trouble and reluctancy as <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenean</hi> did the Croſs of our Saviour, and was now more unwilling to part with it, and did paſſionately declare that his deſire was to leave the dead to bury the dead, and purſue his former enterprize, to avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of having laid his hand to the plough and then looked back, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a building which he could not finiſh: But he had ſtill been educated with ſo much ſubjection to his Imperious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58555:16"/>Parents, who ſo rigorouſly exerciſed their power over him, that as he durſt not gainſay them when they imbarked him into a profeſſion ſo contrary to his inclination, no more durſt he now thwart them when they would bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another ſo contrary to the habits he had contracted amongſt ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties. Auſtere and ſavage Parents, who make Tables of your Families and uſe your Children as you do your Table-men at Cheſs or Tables, place and diſplace them without regard to any thing but your temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, learn not to violate the Will which God has created free, and upon whom he who hath formed the Soul hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelf no conſtraint over it, but is contented to conduct it by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and inſpirations.</p>
               <p>We will leave this Elder Brother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling our ſelves with his Name, becauſe falling Stars have none, but only thoſe that continue fixed to their Spheres; and ſince it is not neceſſary to our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let us leave him to the enjoyment of that Name which God had given him in a better life, and return to the now el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and only remaining Son <hi>Alcimus,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58555:16"/>who is the chief ſubject of our enſuing Narrative. He expreſſed a thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets to his Religious Fathers, to whom he was indebted for his Education, that he muſt now be forced to quit that habit which ſate ſo eaſily upon his body after it had been unwillingly put on; and would far rather have choſen (had it been in his power) to be an abject ſervant in the Houſe of God, than to poſſeſs at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both Riches and Honour in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of the World: But let him think or ſpeak what he will, he has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberty to deliberate nor conſult; and though a grave and Pious Father, who had a good while been his Tutor, remonſtrated to his Parents the ſignal diſaſters which uſually attend ſuch chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he was as little liſtened to or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <p>So much eaſier is it to deſcend than aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend. His Fathers houſe was for him formed into an Academy, where in a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58555:17"/>ſhort time he learnt (ſo well did his active body ſuit his docil wit) the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes fitting for a Man that had changed the Caſſock for a Corſelet, the Book for a Sword. See here the <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to a Human ſtate; He thought no more of the continuation of his daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as if the management of a Horſe were of greater importance than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with God: To quit his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical revenues was the leaſt of his thoughts, for that fat morſel was too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious to his taſte, like <hi>Ruth's</hi> Kinſman, who was willing to redeem the eſtate but not to be troubled with the Woman; there are many willing to receive the benefice, few to diſcharge the office, though the one was deſigned only for a recompence for the other, and that they are or ought to be as inſeparable as the ſhadow and the ſubſtance, the acceſſory and principal. He alledged that it would not be long e're by Marriage he ſhould quite thoſe revenues with his coelibate; but the truth is, he was wholly ruled by his Parents, whoſe deſign was he ſhould keep them till they could light on ſome old Kinſman or ancient Friend on whom they might have them beſtowed, by

               <p>Not conſidering the Flames which are uſually created by theſe Sacrilegious Morſels in the neſts of ſuch rapacious Eagles: finally he continued in this ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar courſe of life to enjoy theſe Spiritual revenues, without the ſmall Tribute of ever officiating in Divine Service: The learned Fathers who had cultivated his Spirit carefully ſo long as his Parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions or his own inclinations deſign'd him for the Church, begun to treat him ſo ſharply, and with ſuch irreſiſtible ſhocks to ſhake the Foundation of his conſcience, as were enough to tear up this impiety by the Roots, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs like a young Tree ſhaken by the wind took faſter footing, till he began to prove to them as a ſtranger &amp; a <hi>Publican,</hi> and reject the practice of the maxims of true Chriſtian Piety and Religion; for to ſpeak truth, what is this but to halt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58555:18"/>between two opinions? to ſwear by God and by <hi>Milcom?</hi> to joyn God with <hi>Baal,</hi> Chriſt with <hi>Belial,</hi> and light with darkneſs? to mix the Eagles feathers with thoſe of the Dove? to make one Sacrifice to God and to Idols? to be at once cold and hot? to eat the fat of the Altar, and never officiate at it? Is not this I ſay to ſow the Earth with two ſorts of grain? to weave a piece of two ſtuffs: and to plough with an Oxe, and an Aſs? They, who admitted not into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Devotion any Souls of a mixt Metal, and conſciences which would not endure the touch, did forthwith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him, or rather <hi>Alcimus</hi> ſeparated from them of his own accord, prodigally rejecting the ſubſtance of his Heavenly Father; not altogether ſo ſhamefully as the young Man in the Goſpel, who fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly and ſottiſhly waſted his Portion in a far Countrey; but yet very unworthily for a Man of his Condition, he turned out of the ways of <hi>Sion,</hi> no more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſolemnities. But the Proverb ſaith, there are no pots ſo ill but there is a cover to fit them; there are no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſo large for commiſſion, but there are others big enough to fit them
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58555:19"/>with an abſolution, there are enow that will praiſe to the wicked the deſires of his Soul, and bleſs him in his iniquity; there are but too many guides that are as little judicious, as infinitly blind, and are not content to be ſo themſelves unleſs they bring others into the ſame predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament: There are flatterers enough, whoſe intereſt makes them ſpeak the Language of ſlaves, and with ſmooth words bring thoſe to ſleep in an aſſured repoſe who have the greateſt ſubject in the World to fear, to whom there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more eaſie than to forge cauſes apparently ſufficient for the unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinure of the goods of the Altar: And an Erroneous conſcience having once taken footing in the Soul, it is then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive all Vice and wickedneſs, which being once rooted there, is as firm as the club in the hand of <hi>Hercules,</hi> it lyes not there, as a paſſenger, but in Garriſon, ingarriſoned in an impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, impregnable fort: It is a great ſin to call good evill, but a monſtrous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to call evil good, and to cloath Vice in Virtues livery; This is to mix Wormwood with Sugar, and poiſon with Honey, it is in one word to reverſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58555:19"/>reaſon and the Laws, and under falſe appearances, to maintain the Sinner in his irregular deſires. We ought not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to judge of any thing: Who knows the ſecrets of God, or who has ever been his Counſellour? who has ever read in the great Book of deſtinies, or ſounded the abyſs of the Heart of Man? Who I ſay, but God, who knows our thoughts afar off, and who judgeth the ways and paths of all, to whom all things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and open, and nothing cloſe or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret? But if we may give a conjecture to Humane actions and Earthly events, it is very probable, that the abuſe of the Churches goods, apply'd to an uſe quite contrary to what they were deſigned for were the cauſes of the misfortunes of that Family; as the Prince of the <hi>Affy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who ſaw the Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation written on the wall for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the Sacred Veſſels to prophane uſes. However it were, our younger Brother was ſucceeding the Elder, went very pompouſly both in habit and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, which was maintained by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance out of his Fathers Patrimony added to his Church Revenues. Behold him here withdrawn from his former
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58555:20"/>innocency, and turned from the paths of his ancient conducters, and now put for the direction of his Soul into the hands of Perſons who had no further care but of the Body.

               <p>He much frequented a holy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fraternity in a Monaſtery near his Houſe, very eminent and much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where he pitcht upon a Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſuted his deſire, whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's own heart I refer it to him, but according to his own he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very agreeable; for he confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his conſcience in his former Courſes, and undertook to bail him from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of thoſe Terrours which his former guides had ſeaſonably imprinted in his Soul, which now ſeemed at laſt but the effects of ſcrupulous conceited old Men; by little and little the fear of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vaniſht from his Soul, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ways to be every day more defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and his heart more hardned; for as an ancient Father ſaith, It is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sin not ſpeedily effaced by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by its heavineſs to weigh a Man down to more, till the multiplication of weights at laſt preſs him to the abyſs of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58555:21"/>miſery, the addition of ſin, like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing burthen growing at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable; thus he paſſed ſome years, even ſleeping in the multitude of riches, and ſplendour of abundance; daily as much increaſing in exteriour accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments befitting a Cavalier, as he impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the inward ones of a Chriſtian. He became a moſt admirable Horſe-Man, or rather changed from a Man to a Horſe, ſo delighting himſelf with that exerciſe, that if it be true that the Lover trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himſelf into the thing beloved, he loving nothing equal to this Animal, it might in ſome ſort be ſaid that he was himſelf become a Brute, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, like the Horſe or Mule that have no underſtanding; for having no care but to aggrandiſe himſelf in riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon Earth, he ſo fixed his regards upon that point, that he had none left for Heaven, whoſe rules he daily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed: But I think I may juſtly ſay by the way, that it ſeldome happens that thoſe who quit God's ſervice for Earthly conſiderations (how juſt and honeſt ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) and proſper long in their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, for God loves not thoſe who ſo ſlightly abandon <hi>Levi</hi>'s Portion: Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58555:21"/>are ſo frequent upon this Subject, that the very Stones would ſpeak if Tongues and Pens ſhould be ſilent; ſo that I conclude this grand proſperity to be this young Lords great misfortune: He was now grown brave, active, ſprightly, and in the greateſt worldly eſteem imaginable; accounted valiant, handſome, generous, of noble deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, learned, rich, compleatly gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and agreeable, his converſation full of attractions, principally amongſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and which crowned all his other perfections, he was reputed very devout, and of a religious behaviour, ſo that there could not one point be found wherein he was not fully accompliſht: inſomuch that every ones doors ſtood open to him, being welcome and deſired in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: Nothing was talk't of but <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his admirable and commendable qualities, as the Miracle of Courteſie, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and Civility: his name paſſed through all mouths, who ſeemed by their infinite praiſes of him, all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to elevate his Honour above the Clouds. But ordinarily the Apple that ripens faſteſt rots the ſooneſt, and that which is moſt yellow is the moſt worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58555:22"/>the faireſt outſide hiding a worm within which in ſhort time conſumes it. The Vulgar who, as the wiſe Man ſaith, hath his eyes only in his head, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a magnificent expence, paſs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor prie into the bottom from whence ſhould proceed the ſubſtance that ſupplies it; and ſo they ſee but a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous uſage of them, mind not whether they were well or ill acquired; but the more ſober ſort, who content not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the out-ſide of the bone, unleſs they come to feed upon the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, pierce with Lynx's eyes the ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt darkneſs, and ſound the moſt hidden reſorts which move the ſtately Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins which ſo dazzle the Eyes of the beholders; to thoſe <hi>Alcimus</hi> his ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did accoutrements ſeemed compoſed of Copes and Chalices, ſhameful orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a Man of Honour: But gain is ſweet whenceſoever it comes, ſaid that baſe minded Emperour, who made the very excrements tributary, and threatned to impoſe a tax upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves.

Thus you ſee that all is not praiſe worthy which the World applauds. Happy is the Man, faith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> that may be praiſed in God, and whoſe worthy commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons God will not ſuffer to be concealed; for to what ſerves the praiſe of all the World without that of Heaven?

This was not but that he was furniſhed (as we had ſaid) with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable qualities, and which is more (as a thing rare in one of his youth, and licentious courſe of life) he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be very Chaſt, and by a good habit which he had contracted in the Seminary, he had a great Antipathy againſt that unclean vice; but his vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſplendidneſs of Habit, train of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſtately Horſes, too much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the World, too much Gaming, and keeping looſe Company, were the weights that remarkably weighed down the other Scale. He paſſed ſome time in this courſe of life, being ſo highly eſteemed through all the City, that none but thought themſelves happy to enjoy his Converſation, and no aſſembly could be compleat unleſs it were ſet off with his admired preſence: he charmed the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58555:23"/>Eyes of moſt of the Female Sex, as much as he excelled moſt of his own, and if their deſires could have been effected, he had been the object of a great many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Not a Mother but deſired him for a Son-in-law, as much as her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coveted him for a Husband: mean while he remained free amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Charms, no Engaging his affection upon any one object, leaving ſo many flames to waſte themſelves, which like coals by little and little dye, if the blaſt's of hope and converſation do not inliven them. He bore Milk and Honey upon his Tongue, (for having much learning he had yet more Art to expreſs it, and it appeared more excellent, the more Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant the Auditors were) but under it he had none, for his diſcourſes had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle coherence with his heart: his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was to breed love in others, but none in himſelf, knowing that a little ſpark of this fire is quickly by degrees blown into a flame, and that the little pleaſure that is reaped thence, is clogged with a thouſand diſcontents: His Parents who deſired nothing more than to ſee him honourably matcht, would have been glad that he could have pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58555:24"/>an object capable to reſtrain his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring affections, and to make his Neck pliable to the Yoke of marriage, which he ſhunned as much as was poſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more enamoured of his liberty than of all the Beauties in the World, not conſidering what horrible wracks thoſe Ships are ſubject to, who thus without either Compaſs or Ballaſt expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the treacherous rocks and winds, and dreadful waves: Thus plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly did he paſs his time, in the height of all Earthly delights, and Worldly pleaſures, without conſidering that,

               <p>Amongſt his other vanities the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt were to be richly habited, bravely mounted, and nobly attended, in ſo much that prancing through the ſtreets, he ſeemed to be the chiefeſt ornament of them, attracted the eyes of all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: It is publickly known by all men that the Nobility of <hi>Italy,</hi> principally during the heats of Summer, do uſually every Evening ride out to take the Air and make many turns and returns
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58555:24"/>through the ſtreets, upon the gallant <hi>Italian</hi> Horſes, or the ſtately <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Courſers, which may well be accounted the moſt excellent Animals upon Earth; this was <hi>Alcimus</hi> his chiefeſt delight. He was exceeding comely and of good grace and behaviour; but it was nothing to ſee him on foot or in a Hall, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the gallantry he ſhewed on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, where, like a compleat Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he performed all the Feats which the moſt expert in that Art had ever found out, he having a marvellous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that way: The Windows of the ſtreets where he paſſed were crouded with as many Admirers as Spectators of his active motions, all giving him the vogue for the moſt compleat Horſe-man living. All that offended him was, that thoſe wicked and infamous Creatures to whom we give the too ſpecious names of

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58555:25"/>abounded with none but Women of ſuch boundleſs wickedneſs, the too frequent meeting of whom is the cauſe of great ſcandal amongſt ſtrangers, by their having ſo much countenance in this Country: This made him reſolve to ſhun the Eyes of theſe <hi>Baſilisks,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his rounds in other leſs frequented ſtreets. O how hard it is to eſcape miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes deſtined to us; how ſhort-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is man into future Affairs and Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: Thinking to avoid the rock of <hi>Scylla</hi> he plunged into the gulf of <hi>Charib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and is taken in a ſnare pitcht in the place where he fled for ſecurity: A ſtreet as large and ſpacious as fair and ſtately was now the Ordinary ſtage where, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a proud Courſer, he exerciſed all the leſſons he had formerly Learnt, his grace and addreſs at this exerciſe drawing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thither from many quarters of the Town to behold him; Here by chance in a broad part of the ſtreet, he often uſed to make a ſtop, over againſt the Gate of a ſumptuous Houſe that ſtood there, which will prove the Theatre on which we ſhall ſee acted a great part of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Tragedy;</hi> For the underſtanding of which we muſt know, that a young Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58555:25"/>called <hi>Vannoza,</hi> had at a very tender Age been very unequally matcht with a man who ſeemed rather her Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then her Husband, which marriage was brought about as I ſhall tell you by and by. We ſhall preſent him to you under the name of <hi>Capoleon,</hi> who being rich, and well deſcended, had been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at a ſeaſon ſo young, as was enough to diſpence with the moſt haſty from joyning themſelves ſo ſoon in the yoke of marriage; and that by the diſpoſal of his Parents, who to agree a ſuit in which a great part of their eſtate lay at ſtake, had Sollicited this marriage with a maid much older then himſelf, who had as great redundancy of years, lack of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, having features leſs apt to breed love than hatred: This Cup though finely gilded, was very bitter to <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s taſt, but the aſcendant that his friends had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his affections, &amp; the fear of ruining his fortune, &amp; leading a miſerable life under the afflictions of Poverty, &amp; his Parents diſpleaſure, made him do like thoſe who ſhut their eyes &amp; ſwallow a loathſom poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having more regard to the ſweetneſs of Health, than the bitterneſs of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, the loathſomeneſs of which begun
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58555:26"/>to appear ſtill worſe when he was come to the age to diſtinguiſh Beauty from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; then did the hook begin to pierce deep, which he had ſwallowed under ſo gilded a bait, but it was not enough that this <hi>Leah</hi> was blear-ey'd, but for a Crown to her other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſhe was Ill-natured, Churliſh, Melancholy, and Proud, and would carry her ſelf more like a Mother to a Son, then a Wife to a Husband, which redoubled <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s vexation, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from a Maſter become a Slave, finding as little kindneſs from her, as ſhe deſerved love from him, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his regard from ſo diſagreeable an Object, to others more pleaſing; a folly ſcarce taken notice of in a Country where it is ſo frequent: This haughty ill tempered woman finding her ſelf in this manner ſlighted by her Husband, was tranſported with ſuch extremities of rage and jealouſie, that her words were not able to expreſs her reſentments. What did ſhe leave unſaid or undone, agitated by this frantick paſſion? ſhe both ſaid and did ſo much as eſſaying too far the patience of his young cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſhe ſtirred up a paſſion in him
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58555:26"/>which proved little advantageous to her ſhoulders: this brought her to all the deſperateſt vows and menaces imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to take a ſevere Revenge either by Force or Treachery; So that in one word, never was a more diſtracted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or unhappy marriage ſince the firſt Sacred Inſtitution of it: the Parents on both ſides endeavoured a reconciliation, but they were Natives of a Country where as quarrel is like a malignant Ulcer, which may be healed outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but will ſtill have matter within to deſtroy the former endeavours of the Chirurgion, or though throughly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will leave a ſcarre which time can never efface: <hi>Capoleon</hi> did not ſo much fear her cruell fury, as her feigned affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, knowing that this Sex has ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with thoſe Creatures, who Flatter when they intend to bite, or of thoſe which kick when one leaſt diſtruſt them: both ſtood upon their Guards, which often bred a miſ-conſtruction of what was never meant amiſs, it being impoſſible for them to draw evenly in that Yoke, which was compoſed of ſuch inequalities. <hi>Capoleon</hi> amongſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men paſt for a bad Husband, though all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58555:27"/>men had juſt occaſion to take his part againſt a wicked Wife: indeed both of them had been wronged by a marriage without eſpouſals, I mean by the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of two Body's whoſe Souls were ſo divided, and humours ſo diſ-joynted; for thoſe marriages which are founded only upon intereſt, ſeldome come to a happy building; and now who could expect any Children from ſo notorious an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy and ſo rare a Commerce.

But the moſt favourable opinion was, That her hard uſage had abridged her Life, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58555:27"/>that the vexation to ſee her ſelf deſpiſed by him whom ſhe thought to be ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to her, for the fortune ſhe brought him, had been the chief weight that had preſt her into her Coffin: And we muſt confeſs that Jealouſie infuſes a Poiſon into the heart, which is not ſo eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the remedy of reaſon, as by that of death; ſo that it may juſtly be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this paſſion, which the Poet appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates to that of love,

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58555:28"/>Libertine, and he led ſuch a courſe of life in his preſent opulency, which he injoyed by the death of her who had left him in the double poſſeſſion of himſelf and her fortune, that might juſtly be ſaid of him, which the Holy Scripture ſaid of an execrable City, That his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity proceeded from his abundance, and that the extremity of his bitterneſs (which is that of his vices) was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of is quietneſs and eaſe: he now went like a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> with his head erected, being ſubject to no Yoke, if he may be ſaid to be free from the Yoke, who is Slave to his Paſſions and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires: It was far more eaſie to number the faults he was free from, than thoſe into which he daily precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated himſelf; for his Soul was a Sea, a receptacle for all the Rivers of ſenſual pleaſures, or rather a ſtinking Lake, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of all ſorts of filth and impurity; and though his Sins merited a ſevere cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement from Heaven, yet the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Soveraign bounty of him who is long-ſuffering and of great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was ſuch towards him, that it might well be ſaid that he indured not the troubles of other men, nor was ſubject

Wherefore having long led a licentious life, and arrived to a well advanced Age, whether it were that his nature was changed by a long habit of vice, or that he ſought a means for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58555:29"/>or moved with a deſire to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Eſtate to a lawful Heir, or that he thought there was no paſſage from the ſin of uncleanneſs but through the gates of marriage, he reſolved upon the ſame Veſſel to venture another ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, thereby ſhewing himſelf to be a man either of very little judgment, or born under a malignant Star for marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; for at firſt being married too young to one that was old and deformed (two inſeparable adjuncts) and which was jealous of him becauſe he was young and luſty; He joyned himſelf the ſecond time, being old and wrinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to a Lady that was very young and incomparably fair, of whom he became enamoured as ſoon as he ſaw her, whom he poſſeſſed as ſoon as he demanded, and of whom he became jealous as ſoon as he enjoyed her; this was the fair <hi>Vannoza,</hi> whom he purchaſed by an artifice which I am about to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>She was born of Parents of very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent quality, and indeed more Eminent for Nobility of Blood than abundance of Riches: he ſaw and fell in Love with her in a great aſſembly, and preſently
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58555:29"/>ſounded her Parents, to whom he made the ordinary offer of amorous old Men, a great Joynture in recompence for a ſmall portion; His propoſition ſeemed ſo advantageous, that it dazled the Eyes of her avaritious Parents, ſo that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cruel cuſtome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they made him a promiſe without making her acquainted, it being there the barbarous Method, (often attended with Evil conſequences) for the Bride and Bride-groom not to ſee one another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of Marriage. And becauſe <hi>Capoleon</hi> knew himſelf to be gray and wrinckled, though he ſtill pretended to be very vigorous, and like the Plants in winter, who hide their vertue under the white ſnow, he was fearful leaſt his eyes ſhould ſtrike into her breaſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Love, rather then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive to it, and therefore communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this miſtruſt to the Parents, who (though they thought their authority ſtrong enough to vanquiſh the averſion of their Daughter) did not miſlike the expedient he propounded of Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſing himſelf, accounting this fraud a lawful one, which redounded to the profit of the deceived; ſo that they took
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58555:30"/>part with the amorous doatard, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their innocent Daughter, and to intice this harmleſs young Dove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſnares. <hi>Capoleon</hi> without imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Medea</hi>'s arts, without caſting his skin like the Snake, or beak with the Eagle, got ſo compleat and handſome a Perruque, that one would have thought (that had not ſeen him before) but that it was his natural hair: he trimmed his beard very curiouſly, and that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that remained was ſo handſomly painted, that it would well have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a chin of thirty years old: he ſo painted and plaiſtered his face, that there remained neither lines nor wrinckles, to betray the age which time had ſtampt upon it. This was not all, for he pitcht upon a young Gentleman of his own ſtature, whoſe garb and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion he imitated the beſt he could in this transformation; him he procured to appear in an aſſembly of Gentlemen, amongſt which <hi>Vannoza</hi> and her Parents were: Him they made her believe to be her deſigned Husband; and ſhe, who ſaw him but by the dim light and ſmoke of Tapers, and amongſt a confuſed company, fancied him not to be very
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58555:30"/>diſagreeable, for ſhe who was now as ripe for Marriage as deſirous of it, was willing to ſubſcribe to her Parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, eſpecially in the Marriage of a young and handſome Gentleman: Thus they made an interview, without any private entertainments, diſcourſe or converſation; being but a meer fantome and illuſion, upon which the poor young Lady was to fix the remainder of her years, not being undeceived till it was too late to remedy the miſtake. Judge then whether this were an action becoming a Nation who account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (and perhaps not untruly except in theſe affairs) the moſt ſage and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the world. At their return home, her Mother asked her amongſt other diſcourſe, how ſhe approved her choice; ſhe who had remarked no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault in him that they had ſhown her, with a diſſimulation proper to her ſex, prudently concealed her ſatisfaction, proteſting that ſhe only ſaw with her Mothers eyes, and that ſuitable to a Daughter of her Birth and Education, ſhe neither had nor ought to have a will diſſonant from that of her Parents. That ſhe would willingly accept of any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58555:31"/>that ſhe would willingly accept of any that was preſented her from their hand, adding to this tender ſubmiſſion the moſt obliging expreſſions befitting ſuch occaſions: Thus was our tender young Hind hunted into the ſnare; ſhe was no ſooner promiſed but affianced to <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> at the twilight of the evening, hidden under the ſhade of a feigned ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice which diſguiſed his real imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: The entertainment was ſo ſhort, and the ſilence ſo deep, his voice never being elevated ſo far as to diſcover the deceit, that he, though an <hi>Eſau,</hi> was taken for a <hi>Jacob,</hi> being deformed with age, he was thought to poſſeſs the beauties of youth; his hoary old age being taken for ſprightly youthfulneſs by a prepoſſeſſed ſpirit. The Marriage was ſolemnized a few days after, but in the night time, where he appearing in ſumptuous apparel, more fitting for a far younger man, and ornaments ſo gaudy as were as unfitting to his ſex as age, paſſed by the out-ſide for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat young Gallant: In ſum, <hi>Vannoza</hi> thinking to have married a young Gentleman, wakened the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58555:31"/>the wife of an old one, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caſt off his youth over night with his Peruque, appearing in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Leah</hi> formerly did to <hi>Jacob.</hi> None but ſouls aſſailed with ſuch ſurprizes, could imagine the greatneſs of theſe; Poor ſimple innocent! ſhe thought it had been Marriage which ſo ſoon made young perſons old; and trembling and fearful, ſhe run to her glaſs, to ſee if wrinckles had not made as bold with her forehead as with her husbands, and whether her hairs were not become as white as her face was pale with fear, in which ſhe thought ſhe ſaw the image of death ſtamped, the fright had ſo dazled her eyes, till by little and little ſhe begun to undeceive her ſelf, the remembrance of her changing ſo lately her Virgin ſtate, did alſo help to bring the blood into her face, and mixing the Roſes again amongſt the Lillies, and adding a lively colour to her cheeks, made her perceive that her flouriſhing beauty had not left her with her Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The husband rallyed all his wit to charge her with excuſes, her Parents alſo running to aſſiſt him, dazling the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58555:32"/>eyes of this poor young Lady with the riches of her new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

Thus was ſhe brought from her firſt aſtoniſhment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a courſe of life which however diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to her, ought to give all the content imaginable to <hi>Capoleon,</hi> and promiſed to recompence him with a free injoyment of thoſe felicities which his former nuptials had denied him: In a word, this affair was conducted with ſuch brevity and induſtry, that <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> was married before any ſuch thing was talked or thought of; and now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one begun to hope well of his future Converſation, and that the honourable bonds of Matrimony would tye him up from his former diſhonourable actions. But whether a diſordinate ſpirit carry inquietude along with it, as Devils do
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58555:32"/>their hell, or whether by misfortune he had conſpired againſt his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he who had firſt given all reaſonable liberty to his Wife that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, permitting her with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee and injoy the Company of their ancient friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to frequent what places of devotion ſhe pleaſed, being on a ſuddain inflamed with the fire of Jealouſie, which is as fierce as that of Hell, he begun like <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to change his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance toward her, and to change thoſe Sun-ſhiny days into obſcure nights, he found himſelf to be old and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her young and beauteous; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which he perceived in her, and the defaults which he remarked in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were the only faults of this young innocent; Nothing but adminiſtred fewel to this flame: If any one lookt upon her, it was with a luſtful eye; if any one ſpoke to her prejudice, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it; or if they praiſed her, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from deſigns prejudicial to his honour: The very rays of the Sun were too familiar with her, and <hi>Zephyrus</hi> took too much liberty to ſport about her breaſts, the flies that chanced to pearch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58555:33"/>upon her face kiſſed her, and the habits which ſhe wore touched her too near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He thought her ſo weak that any thing was able to corrupt her: The thoughts that every one was covetous of this Gold, wrought in him a deſign of burying ſo deſirable a Creature from all mens ſight, and the light of the day: But had he brought about this deſign with better conduct, and had by little and little reſtrained his liberty, and Eclipſed this Star by degrees from the eyes of the World by ſome conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vapours which time ſhould form into clouds; had he but gently accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Bird to the reſtraints of a Cage, this ſlave to the chain, perhaps in a Country where Captivity is ſo ordinary amongſt Women, that it is even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Nature, he had not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently exaſperated her ſpirit, and deſire of eſcaping, and had pluckt up the root of many hard conſtructions and evil ſpeeches againſt his unreaſonable ſeverity: But what is it but to expect freſh water from the Sea, for one to look for kind uſage from a man blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with jealouſie? is it not to demand reaſon of one that has loſt it? to ſeek
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58555:33"/>for grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles? Thoſe that ſay that this malady is an exceſs of Love, as the Fever is of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, do therein confeſs that though it be a ſort of Love it is but a ſick one; and as a hot and burning Fever brings us even to the neighbourhood of death, ſo a hot and flaming jealouſie is eaſily brought to conſume the fewel of Love that feeds it: it turns the ſweet and gentle heat into a Calenture, from whence proceed the ſharpeſt effects of hatred, which will not ſtop ſhort of an attempt upon the life, or at leaſt of as precious liberty. Thus where this paſſion fixeth, being born of real love it does at laſt ruine it, as the moth eats the cloth in which it took its being. All <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s deſire was to preſerve his Wife entirely to himſelf, and to perfect that deſign, he lodgeth her in a Chamber the fitteſt he could find out for a Priſon, not conſidering that in confining the body he disjoyns the ſoul of affection from it, which ſhould be the only guard to preſerve it to him.</p>

               <p>We have ſaid that amongſt the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in which <hi>Alcimus</hi> was moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that of managing a Horſe was chief, and that prancing ordinarily through the ſtreets, advantageouſly mounted and accoutred, and ſtrutting in the pomp and gallantry of his habits, like the Peacock in the variety of his plumes, he paſſed often by <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s houſe, this ſtreet pleaſing him the moſt, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large and fair, and moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his exerciſing his Horſe in thoſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58555:38"/>motions he had learnt him; and, as we have ſaid, he did it with ſuch rare dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity that he never wanted abundance of beholders both in the ſtreets and windows. <hi>Vannoza</hi> during her former liberty had often beheld him in theſe poſtures, through the bars and treillices of the windows, which by reaſon of their uſe are there called Jealouſies; but upon the entry of her new courſe of life, being wholly taken up in the cold affection and converſation of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, this Idea had ſcarce any room left in her ſpirit, much leſs to take up a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. <hi>Capoleon</hi> himſelf took a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular pleaſure in ſeeing theſe gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of this young Cavalier, and with exceſſive praiſes, raiſed his excellency and dexterity to the very clouds: He had ſhut up his Wife in a remote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, this ſpectacle, as moſt others, being ſuſpected by him, and therefore reſerved it only to his own ſight. One evening as He and his Wife were taking the Air in the Garden, one of his Lacqueys came to tell him, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi> was in the ſtreet at his uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and that upon a ſtately <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> Courſer he performed wonders, to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58555:38"/>the admiration of all beholders. <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> on a ſuddain left his Wife, to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the flowers with her tears, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himſelf with this pleaſing ſpectacle. <hi>Vannoza</hi> though ſhe ſaid nothing, thought never the leſs; ſhe durſt neither follow him nor ask leave to do ſo, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to his ſuſpicious brain this might bring ſome ſiniſter ombrage of her fidelity, and therefore ſitting very penſively down in a cloſe Arbour, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing her ſelf in tears, ſhe diſcharged her ſelf of part of her ſorrows, in exhaling theſe following regrets, often interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with deep ſighs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To what has the rigorous influence of my unhappy ſtars reſerved me? muſt I thus dye before death's approach, and like a criminal Veſtal be buried alive? Certainly when one has by a bad deportment merited puniſhment, the rigour of the pain is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moderated by the conſideration of the juſtneſs of it, but to ſuffer an unjuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the rudeſt eſſay can be made upon humane patience; and what patience ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed would not turn to fury? Why ſhould I beſtow ſo much time on my complaints, and none upon my revenge? Dye then, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58555:39"/>Vannoza, <hi>and by one generous death cut off a thouſand daily renewing and languiſhing ones, which every hour afflict thee. The cold and pale-faced Moon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more Icy than thy Husband, nor the ſhades more horrible than his preſence; They deſerve to live miſerable that know not how to eſcape afflictions by a courageous death. But, muſt I dye then unrevenged? ſince revenge to the heart of a Woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed like me, is a pleaſure far ſweeter than life: Thus ſhall we ſet Furies upon our</hi> Cerberus, <hi>who ſhall ſufficiently tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him, and make him experiment the extremities to which he hath reduced us.</hi>

               <p>She had farther purſued this furious diſcourſe, if the fear of being heard, joined to the multitude of her ſighs, had not ſtopped the words that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this interruption of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe gave more liberty to her thoughts, which came to nettle her ſpirit with the words which the Lacquey had ſpoke before her, ſo much to <hi>Alcimus</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; words which were oil to the flames of her deſire: It is an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on incident to humane nature, to deſire
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58555:39"/>that moſt earneſtly which is moſt ſtrictly forbidden; And if this flame do ſeize ſo furiouſly on the green wood of man's ſpirit, what deſtruction will it make among the dry? In that of a Woman, who is more fiercely agitated the more unable ſhe is to reſiſt.

               <p>And this indeed was ſufficient to whet her appetite, to call away <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> from her company to ſee the gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> it did indeed prick forward her deſire of taking her turn and leaving <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s Company to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſight of <hi>Alcimus</hi> her ſelf: Thus ſhe reſolved to feed her eyes with this lovely object, like the inconſiderate fly that raſhly approaching the candle, burns it ſelf in it: There was over the apartment, whoſe walls bounded her liberty, a Garret in which ſhe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be deſirous of building a little Hermitage, there to make a retreat for the better contemplating on heavenly matters, like another <hi>Judith:</hi> ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that from thence ſhe might paſs to the main part of the Houſe which fronted the ſtreet, (and was kept from her approach) over the top of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery which joined to her apartment,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58555:40"/>through which Gallery her husband uſually came to her. His project ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to her deſign; ſo that having made a Cabinet there of boards, ſhe made it be adorned and hung with Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Pictures; ſo ſeeming to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry devout, ſhe uſed to ſhut her ſelf in there, to attend more carefully the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the pious <hi>Mary,</hi> though her heart bore the impreſſions of far worſe actions than thoſe of the buſie <hi>Martha.</hi> Being retired into this remote place, ſhe paſſed over the top of the Gallery we ſpoke of, into the Garret of the main body of the houſe which fronted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtreet, where through the window ſhe might eaſily ſee there all that paſſed to and fro; thus according to her deſire ſhe obtained the means of ſeeing the world. Amongſt others, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi> failed not in the evening to come out to take the air, richly habited, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attended, and compleatly mounted, making his ordinary corvets and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery; and as he bore innocency in his ſpirit, ſo did he ingenuity in his looks; and though he was not altogether clear of all faults, yet that of a little vanity was the chief, and he never harboured
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58555:41"/>thoſe unclean and vile thoughts which now ſeized the breaſt of this bird that thus peeped at him through her cage.

She was now feignedly become extream devout, which infinitely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Husband, who not being able to judge but by the out-ſide, imagined that her Honour was now fenced with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rampart, ſince the Exerciſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion would ſerve for a pleaſing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in her ſolitude, and that the fear and love of God taking up her thoughts, would breed in her a horrour of ſin, and a deteſtation of all other than lawful affections, reſembling the Mother of Pearl, which in the middle of the ſalt waves of the Sea, receives no other moiſture than what proceeds from from the Dew. He could not refrain his praiſes of her, and extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes, to teſtifie his joy to ſee her mix together her devotion towards God, and her duty towards him: See here a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band become a Preacher, a good Husband certainly, far more careful and curious of the Conſcience of his fair Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than of his own: Admirable Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!

                  <hi>Capoleon</hi> became the Trumpet of his Wives Devotion; he thought her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in her private Cloſet in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, in the ſame Exerciſes with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Bethulian</hi> Widow; believing that her Contemplations were wholly upon Heavenly Objects, which were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fixed upon an earthly one, whilſt he managed his Horſe in the Street: <hi>Vanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> ſeeing that her Train had taken ſire, and that her Husband accounted her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry devout, ceaſed not to beat this Iron whilſt it was hot, holding him in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Piety and Heaven (though both as far diſtant from her heart, as the later is from the Earth) even unto Viſions and Revelations, ſometimes interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sighs and Exclamations, with turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her eyes almoſt in a feigned exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſpeaking nothing but of hair-Cloaths, and Mortification, heaping up abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Images, and Books of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, recounting pieces of Sermons, which ſhe retained in her Memoty, and ſome Tracts of the Lives of Saints, which ſo raviſhed the ſpirit of the old Man, that he could not take her for leſs than a Saint, and termed her his Tutelary Angel, who inwardly accounted him her Guardian-Devil.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58555:46"/>Devil. Nothing ſo much pleaſeth the old Husband of a young Wife, as to ſee her piouſly inclined, imagining that ſhe will there find ſuch ſatisfactions of ſpirit, that ſhe will never eſteem thoſe of the fleſh. Thus <hi>Capoleon</hi> thought that this deſign in him of impriſoning his Wife, proceeded from Divine Inſpiration, God having uſed that means to accompliſh ſo good a Work. He begun to have more conſidence in her, and to teſtifie by ſome more than ordinary Careſſes, that ſhe ſhould never want his affections in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of thoſe ſhe had fixed upon God; and that his love ſhould ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe towards her, as hers did towards Heaven. After this ſhe made her pious retreats laſt ſomewhat longer; but this was more to watch the paſſage of him who was the light of her eyes, than to content her ſpirit with Celeſtial Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. None in the Houſe knew of this Artifice, and had her very ſmock known it, it had been in eminent danger of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſhe knew how dangerous it would be to truſt either to a Maid, or Lacquey, who were ſo many Spies and Sentinels kept in Pay by her Husband, to keep a ſtrict watch on all her Actions.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58555:46"/>And now what was ſhe able to do, being alone confined, revengeful and amorous? She muſt uſe ſome means to eſcape from this perplexity, either through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Deſpair, or the door of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. A religious Artifice, that was the door of the Temple, which ſhe thought to be ſpecious, but was very fallacious; wherefore ſhe reſolved,

               <p>One day as ſhe was Cajoling her aged <hi>Tithon,</hi> (according to the Cuſtome of Women when they mean to deceive) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling her toyings and careſſes, ſhe proteſted to him, That Impriſonment in his company was the higheſt happineſs ſhe coveted on Earth; and ſo ſhe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but the ſight of him, all others in the World were indifferent to her; ſo ſhe might but enjoy this ſhadow of liberty to go to the Churches in the Company and Conduct of her Mother, to procure Indulgences, to frequent the Sacraments and Confeſſions, and to hear Sermons:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58555:47"/>That all other Exerciſes beſides theſe and her domeſtique ones were as contrary to her temper, as fire to water, ſhe being no more concerned for the companies and converſations of the World, than if ſhe had never ſeen nor known it: She knew ſo well to colour this juſt requeſt with ſweet and plauſible words, and to accompany her diſſimulation with ſuch real tears, that <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s heart was not ſo ſteely but to be ſoftened by them; or had it been of ſtone, the falling of theſe ſtreams had been enough to wear it: He took her inſide to be as lovely as her out, and that both ways though clothed with fleſh ſhe was altogether Spiritual; and that though yet on Earth, ſhe breathed nothing but what was Angelical: He thought that ſo holy a requeſt could not be rejected without impiety; And that he could not without meriting ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judgment from Heaven, reſiſt the motions of the holy Spirit, and ſtop the progreſs of Grace in this holy Soul. The Proverb ſaith, That it is hard to find a trick to catch the old one, ſince their long experience has armed them againſt all devices; Yet this young Wit, refined by a Paſſion which inſpires the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58555:47"/>with ſubtlety, needed not to go to School to the moſt ancient Crafts-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. <hi>Capoleon</hi> falls into the ſnare, and opening the door to a ſeeming Piety, he lets in the blackeſt miſchiefs. Wine ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after <hi>Hemlock,</hi> is a good Antidote againſt its poyſon, becauſe its gentle heat refreſhing the heart, tempers the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal coldneſs of the other: but when they are both ſwallowed together, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no further remedy; for the one opening the pectoral veins, makes the deadly venom of the other a more eaſie entrance, and renders it ſo penetrating and active, that the vital heat is ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſh't. In like manner the moſt puiſſant remedy after the poiſon of ſin, is the ſupernatural heat of grace, (Grace which is the true enlivener of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) which does temper the natural fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity of the Soul; the Sacraments and other Divine Myſteries, are the Conduit-Pipes that convey this Divine Mercy from the Fountain of Salvation; but when one ſwallows them down mixed with the venome of Sin, then ſurely this iniquity is deplorable, which turns the Haven to a Whirl-pool, the Potion to a Poiſon.</p>

See here our <hi>Iſraelite</hi> under the rod of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers direction, delivered from the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> of her Priſon, and the Captivity of her <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to go feed upon the Manna of abſolution, and the Word of God, in the deſarts of Penitence: But her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58555:48"/>was to paſs that way into a Land of Promiſe that flowed with Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney far from Coeleſtial. To render her Stratagem more Compleat, ſhe clothed her ſelf the meanlieſt that was poſſible, and promiſed her husband to veil her face ſo diligently, that none but a <hi>Lynx</hi> his eyes ſhould perceive it; all which he believed as Oracles: Her Mother aſtoniſht to ſee her in this equipage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſorrowful for her fixing upon ſo ſtrict a devotion, fearing it would end in a deſtructive Melancholy: Her Maids that followed her, fancied that they had an inviſible Miſtriſs, and that ſhe rather ſeemed a moving ſhadow, than a real ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Capoleon</hi> who according to the cuſtome of the Jealous, watch'd her with <hi>Argus</hi> eyes, could eſpy nothing but moſt devout and modeſt; and as he loved nothing more then the ſight of her when ſhe was at home, he now cheriſht the thoughts of her, whil'ſt ſhe was abroad. Thus did ſhe dazzle the Eyes of all Men, and was ſo diligent a manager of her time, that in a few days ſhe had learnt all the Jubiliees, the Stations, Fraternities, Feaſts and Sermons that were in the whole City, and had all the Kalender by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58555:49"/>heart. She was ſeen to go from one Church to another, and from Monaſtery to Monaſtery ſtill at her Mothers heels, as if ſhe had ſtill continued an obedient young Daughter; which was a ſight commended by all the beholders: Mean while her deſigns were ſo ſecret, That the moſt Curious Imagination would not in the leaſt have ſuſpected the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt part of them. All thought it was the Mother that conducted the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; when indeed it was the Daughter was the Shepherdeſs, who though ſhe came behind, drove her Leader whither ſhe pleaſed; ſo deſirous was this good Woman of the Spiritual Conſolation of her beloved Daughter.</p>
               <p>One would have thought ſhe had gone with violence and fervour to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Heaven, when her Enterprizes were all fixed upon Earth; like Eagles, who when they tour aloft in the Air, have their thoughts ſtill fix'd below to fall upon the firſt prey they can eſpy. Her veil concealed her from the ſight of others, but hindered her not from the ſight of divers objects which preſented themſelves to her ſight, which above all deſired to ſatiate its ſelf with the ſight of

There was a certain Sunday in which an eminent Fraternity of the City cauſed a great Proceſſion to be made, the ſolemnity and Indulgences of which drew a great many people thither to be partakers. Our feigned Saint, who was very zealous for gaining Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, failed not to be there with her Mother. <hi>Alcimus,</hi> whether by his good or evil <hi>Genius</hi> I know not, was drawn thither. It was in this occurrence that <hi>Vannoza</hi> invented a ſtratagem as horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the end it was deſigned for was wicked. <hi>Alcimus</hi> in order to prepare himſelf for the holy Table, intending to examine his Conſcience, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himſelf of the faults he ſhould find there, went to make his confeſſion at the feet of his ordinary Confeſſor, who was a Religious Father, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Monaſtery, and who then diſcharged the Office of Confeſſor in that Solemnity: <hi>Vannoza</hi> whoſe head was filled with other deſigns then thoſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58555:50"/>that ſeemed to bring her thither, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered attentively all his actions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the place where he went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit of Abſolution, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like a crafty venomous Spider, there to pitch her net to trap this innocent fly: She goes a little while after as if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of the like Medicine from the ſame holy Phyſician, there accuſing her ſelf of ſome little feigned crimes, which made her admired by this holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, who judging of the Bird by her note, thought he had met a ſoul made up of purity and perfection: Thus did ſhe caſt duſt, or rather ſeemingly divine rays in the eyes of this good man which dazled them ſo far as to take her for little leſs then a Saint: and as there is nothing of equal conſolation to thoſe that work in God's Vineyard, in this troubleſome office, which of Confeſſors makes them Martyrs, as to meet amongſt the thorns of a thouſand iniquities, with which their ears are daily peſtered, the roſes of ſome beauteous ſouls, moiſtned with the dew of grace, and which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſweet ſavour in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> this good Father bleſſed God, and all that was within him did praiſe his holy name,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58555:51"/>that he had yet reſerved to himſelf in the world ſuch holy ſouls and faithful ſervants, who inſtead of bending the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> and worſhipping the calves of <hi>Bethel,</hi> did endeavour to work out their ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. This crafty penitent finding by the good man's pious praiſes of heaven for the divine graces which he thought lodged in her Soul, that her diſſembled holineſs was rooted in his belief, having humbled her ſelf the beſt ſhe could, with the moſt artificial words ſhe could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, like bladders puft full of wind, which bound the higher, the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly they are thrown againſt the ground; ſo ſhe continuing ſtill a more zealous diſcourſe, and painting her ſelf with the colours of a Woman, moſt deſirous to pleaſe God, and preſerve her honour, ſent out a flood of <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi>-tears, mixt with a ſigh which ſeemed to proceed from the bottom of her breaſt, which were followed with theſe following words;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas! Father,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>may I without offending God, diſcover to you ſome of the imperfections of my Neighbour: God knows that it is for no ill will I bear him,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58555:51"/>for I deſire him as much happineſs as my ſelf; it is only for the avoiding a grand diſaſtre which hangs over his head, and which threatens no leſs then the loſs of his life, and the ruine of my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>

               <p>Daughter, <hi>(anſwered the Confeſſor)</hi> you are not ignorant of the ſeal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the ſame thing you think in your mind, you may as ſafely reveal here; for whatſoever is buried in the ears of Confeſſors, does never come to a reſurrection; Nor can I imagine you can think me ſo ignorant of the grand importance of theſe holy ſecrets, which cannot be revealed without my loſing both life and honour; nor ſo wicked as to outrage my conſcience ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſo unworthy an action, upon which accounts you may aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in my fidelity, and freely commit this ſecret to my truſt, not diſtruſting the faithfulneſs to which all Laws both Divine and Humane oblige me: I am to the Soul what the Midwife is to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, aiding it in the diſcharge of that weight, which preſſeth it down with an inſupportable burthen: It belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you to judge in what my interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

               </p>
               <p>What! <hi>ſaid</hi> Simplicius, <hi>Alcimus</hi> covet another man's Wife! O execrable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge! O mighty God! where is thy Thunder? I have long governed the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this man, but have never either perceived, or heard ſuch a thing of him; but truſt this to me, and if he come not to ſee me ſpeedily, I will go ſeek and find him out, and endeavour to waſh his Soul with ſo ſcouring a Sope, as with God's aſſiſtance ſhall lick away this odious ſpot:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58555:53"/>I feel zeal enough to dare to attempt, and hope I have influence enough upon him to perfect the plucking up ſo pernicious a root from his heart: And if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to remark the particulars to him, it will be from you by me, or rather from God by us both, that he will obtain the ſalvation of his Soul; for it is written, <hi>That he that retrieves his Brothers ſoul from the path of ruine, 'tis delivering his Soul from death, does at the ſame time ſave his own:</hi> and is it not an excellent way of working ones own ſalvation in that of another, and this properly belongs to the Religious, who to Monaſtique Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do joyn the Prieſtly.</p>

Now you muſt know, Father, that Jealouſie (is almoſt an inſeparable Companion of old men, married to young wives) has ſo poſſeſt my Husbands heart, that excepting my walks to the Churches &amp; places of Devotion, which yet is done in company of my Mother (which is the ancient Lady which you ſee here ſo near your Confeſſional) I am the reſt of my time priſoner in a remote Apartment of the Houſe, which only looks into the Garden, where I have no other entertainment, but that of Images, Books of Devotion, and my ſolitary thoughts; ſufficiently happy in this retreat, in which I have the happineſs of pleaſing my Husband, and converſing with God, if I did not fear, that ſo many follies which</hi> Alcimus <hi>commits before all the world, and particularly in the ſight of my Husband</hi> Capoleon, <hi>may force him to the extremity of laying an ambuſh for him, and take away his life in ſo unprovided a condition, as may render the hopes of his Salvation deſperate; for to die in the unchaſte purſuit of another's Wife, is but a crooked way to the eternity of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58555:54"/>Glory: I have already diſcovered ſome of my Husbands menaces, and perceiv'd him to plot with his Servants and ſome</hi> Bravo's, <hi>againſt this young Gentleman, which cannot be executed without a probability of bringing</hi> Capoleon <hi>to deſtruction,</hi> Alcimus <hi>to Hell, and me into the ſlanderous mouths of detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, whoſe throat is an open ſepulchre; where I ſhould ſee my Honour unjuſtly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Judge then, Father, if I have not reaſon to advertiſe you of this miſchief which hangs over the head of</hi> Alcimus, <hi>that he may get into Harbour, to avoid this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and ſlip from the ſhot of this bended Bowe, and that by ſorſaking ſo unjuſt a Paſſion, he may ſave himſelf from ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In truth Daughter, <hi>reply'd</hi> Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, you include many vertuous acts in one; for beſides the teſtimony of your honeſty, and your inviolable fidelity to your Spouſe, you uſe a grand and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal prudence, to prevent the many ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which might ſucceed ſo pernicious a deſign; and principally you manifeſt an extream charity towards this wretched offender, who does juſtly merit to periſh in his iniquity: But we ought ſtill to hope well of Divine mercy and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58555:55"/>Converſion, above all when the iniquity is but in its Infancy, whiles the young man is yet within the gate, or <hi>Jairus</hi> his <hi>Tabitha</hi> within the houſe, without attending <hi>Lazarus</hi> his four days corruption, till an inveterate habit have rendred him incurable. But yet, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he,</hi> may I not yet be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed (that I may more clearly carry my ſelf in this affair) of ſome particulars of the unhappy ſearch of this young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent? I queſtion not but that againſt the conſtancy of your honeſty, his ſighs and tears are but winds and waves ſpent upon a rock: but how far has his vanity proceeded? has your Husband yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it? or is he yet come to open words, threats, and bravadoes, or only to ſmall ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I thank God,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>he is not yet come to the extremities you firſt ſpecified, but he is upon the eſſay you laſt mentioned; for</hi> Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <hi>his purſuits are ſo evident, that none, except blind, but muſt needs remark him; for every evening, under pretences of taking the Air, and managing his Horſe (in which, and in his Attendance he has an extream vanity) he has pickt out our Street, which is fair and ſpacious, for the Theatre of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58555:55"/>(ſhall I ſay) or Follies, and this to endeavour to draw me to the window, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other inconſiderate young ones, there to ſee my face; from the Ice and coldneſs of which towards him, he hath raiſed ſuch a flame, as rages with ſo much more puiſſance, as it finds in him leſs reſiſtance; for this Paſſion is ſo voluntary an evil, that it tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments us no longer than we pleaſe, and ſo no longer than we give it the Sovereignty of our Hearts. In the beginning of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, when I had the liberty to go into what parts of the Houſe I pleaſed, I became one of his beholders, and thereby the innocent cauſe of his Paſſion, without giving him any ſubject for it.</hi> Capoleon <hi>himſelf, who took great pleaſure in ſeeing him in theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and who in his time has been a good Horſeman, uſed to bring me to ſee him; but ſince his Jealouſie has confin'd me to a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Houſe far remote from the ſtreet, 'tis in vain for</hi> Alcimus <hi>to make his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to and fro; for I am wholly eclipſed from his eyes: But he is of the number of thoſe fooliſh Lovers, who content themſelves with the ſight of thoſe Wells, which incloſe the Object of their flames; like Elephants, who not daring to ſwim in a water which has not depth enough to ſupport them, waſh
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58555:56"/>themſelves by walking along the edge of a River, where they are oft either taken or ſlain: And I am ſo afraid, leſt this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Bird, if it take not heed, be ſhot by an Arrow feathered from its own wing, or catcht in lime-twigs of its own pitching; for as every man is the Artificer of his own good, ſo is he of his own bad fortune: I hear the Winds riſe, the Waves roll, and the Tempeſt approach; my Husband, to whom all things bring cauſe of ſuſpition, yet knows that I am not at all deſirous of the ſight of this Cavalier, and is hugely offended that theſe paſſages are a common Table-talk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Neighbourhood, amongſt whom the murmur runs, that he makes all theſe turns for a Bird that</hi> Capoleon <hi>keeps enca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, meaning me. May it therefore pleaſe you, moſt holy Father, to do this charitable office to him, my Husband, and my ſelf, to prevent ſo great a miſchief and ſcandal, by advertiſing him for the future to leave off this unprofitable purſuit, which can neither be advantageous nor honourable, except he deſire to be continually in danger; till per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at laſt, amongſt theſe turns and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he may light on one, he neither ſought nor thought of, which is that which leads from life to death. I being ſo cloſe ſhut up
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58555:56"/>as I am, could not have opportunity to give him any advice of this by any of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, leſt they ſhould ſuſpect betwixt us ſome ſecret intelligence, and that my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who ſets them as ſo many Spies about me, ſhould not have a pretext to treat me more rigorouſly; and as I was juſt going to truſt this important Secret to this ancient Lady you ſee here, (who though my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is ſtill a woman, and my own frailty tells me, how bad a repoſitory our Sex is for ſuch privacies) God inſpired me juſt upon that inſtant to come to your holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, having ſeen him part from you; ſo that for the future, I ſhall rely upon your prudence and charity, to give a remedy to theſe threatning Misfortunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Daughter (<hi>reply'd the good Father</hi> Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius) ſince you not only permit, but enjoyn me to open my mouth upon this Subject, for the good and ſafety of ſo many Souls, I ſhall willingly obey you in ſo juſt an occaſion, which concerns the Glory and Service of God, whom I ſerve, therefore rely upon me, and I will apply my utmoſt diligence to cut the thread of his folly; be you only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, devout, and faithful, and take this Maxime from me, That the beſt and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58555:57"/>greateſt Policy and Invention, is to keep a good Conſcience, and to walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God; have a good courage and confidence in the Divine Bounty, and fear not but truth and purity will be your Safe-guard. Whereupon having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her his bleſſing, he diſmiſs'd her in peace.</p>
               <p>Imagine with your ſelf, whether this ſubtle woman might not well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Rower that turns his Bark to the Port he aims at; whether to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, her diſcarding of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus,</hi> were not the ruine of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. But infinite are the Inventions of the heart, when it is infected with the Poyſon of the old Serpent, who was a Murtherer from the beginning, and by whom Sin entred into the World, with Death for its attendant. None make up directly and openly to Iniquity, there muſt be always ſome Colour or Leaves to hide it, or elſe it would appear too openly; it has always a ſpecious out-ſide, and though the in-ſide of the Coin be plain braſs, it will be ſure to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly plated over. <hi>Vannoza</hi> being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Father <hi>Simplicius,</hi> told her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſhe had found ſo much edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58555:57"/>in his Remonſtrances, and ſuch profit in his Inſtructions, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ſhould be her only Confeſſor; which pleaſed her Mother very much, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing more than the contentment of her Daughter, who in thoſe words only ſowed the Seed of a ſpeedy return, to know whether that Match which ſhe had lighted, had given fire to the Train of her wicked Intentions. Mean while, the good Religious Father, hurried on by his zeal, without attending <hi>Alcimus</hi> his coming, whoſe loſs he apprehended, went to viſit him in his houſe, as he did at other times before, as well in quality of a Neighbour, as to cultivate the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of ſo good a Benefactor to the Fraternity, and to mix a little prudence with his plainneſs, knowing by common Opinion as well as Experience, that all the words of women are not Oracles: he made private inquiries if it were true that this Gentleman went ſo in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, prancing through the ſtreet where <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s houſe was; which he found to be very true; and which was more (as every thing gives cauſe of ſuſpition in this jealous Nation) that he was much ſpoken of for his gallantry and brave Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58555:58"/>Hence the good man conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>Vannoza</hi>'s report was but too true. Therefore being with <hi>Alcimus,</hi> after many Diſcourſes and ordinary Entertainments, he fell, as if by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, upon the Diſcourſe of Serenades and Gallantries in the Streets, which this young Gentleman ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; and withal told him, That to avoid the eyes of ſo many infamous Courtizans as throng'd the Windows to behold him, he ſhunned as diligently as was poſſible the places affected with that accurſed Race, for that end paſſing through the more remote and leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ones; confeſſing further, the pleaſure he took in this exerciſe, in which he drew the Opinions of all Beholders to reckon him for excellent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do you diſapprove of it as ſinful? or can this kind of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, (for that is the worſt title it can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) amount to a heinous offence? For to be ſeen, taken notice of, praiſed, eſteemed and admired, is a thing very ordinary amongſt Academies, which pleaſing applauſe does undeniably tickle the heart through the ear.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:58555:58"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Simplicius</hi> thinking he had brought <hi>Alcimus</hi> to the point deſired, begun preſently to tell him, <q>That this paſſing through the ſtreets, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on foot or horſeback, was in it ſelf a thing indifferent; but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different actions took the tincture ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of good or evil form the deſigns and determinations which were intermixt with them; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo good but may be corrupted by a malignant ſpirit, and from which, like a ſpider, it may not ſuck poiſon. Nor any thing ſo evil from which a well-diſpoſed ſpirit may not draw ſome advantage. That feaſts, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, aſſemblies, dancing, honeſt plays and recreations, habits, and ſuch like, were of this nature, and were neither to be praiſed or condemned, but according to the uſage or abuſe, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or exceſs of thoſe that uſe them: But that humane nature and inclinations were ſo inclined and bent towards the vanities of youth, that as if our very touch were infectious, we are apt to corrupt the very beſt things by handling, much more indifferent ones. So wine and meats, which are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58555:59"/>given to ſuſtain the body, ſerve for objects of daintineſs to one, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to another, and gluttony to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and amongſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58555:59"/>whence proceed murmures, curious inquiries, hard ſpeeches and ſcandals: And if the object be unlawful to be deſired, then the Woman is perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with infamy, the Husband rackt with jealouſie, till he breathe out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fury and revenge; for how can he otherwiſe contain himſelf, who ſees his wife courted before his face, and himſelf thereby ſubjected to the reproaches of the world, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the people: From this ſource ſpring great and dangerous accidents, which it is more eaſie to avoid then remedy, when arrived.</q>
               </p>

                     <hi>It is not without ſome cauſe, Seigneur</hi> Alcimus, <hi>that I make you this diſcourſe, for I have from good hands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a bad report of you, and I aſſure you I could never have thought or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that a ſoul ſo ſeemingly fair as yours, would by the eaſie way of deceiving men, paſs ſo unworthily to the dangerous one of offending God: but deceive not your ſelf, for none can mock God with impunity, if he withold his vengeance, it is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double his ſtroke. I ſhould be a traitor

               <p>If ever man were ſurprized or aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, it was <hi>Alcimus,</hi> who ſeeing his innocence burthened with a Crime
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58555:60"/>which the other did not name, nor he imagine, did at once change colour an hundred times; and theſe alterations, cauſed by his ſincerity and ingenuity, were by <hi>Simplicius,</hi> who ſtedfaſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded him, taken for the effects of guilt, and remorſe of Conſcience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, <hi>Take Courage, Seigneur</hi> Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, <hi>all will be well, that skarlet of your bluſhes does elevate my hopes, and makes me attend your ingenuous and free Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Alcimus,</hi> who felt his Conſcience clogged with nothing but the deteinure of his Church-Revenues, of which we have amply treated in the beginning of this Narrative, did like thoſe that are ſtruck, preſently lay his hand on the bruiſed ſpot, where he felt the pain. And after calling to mind how he had often conferred about this Affair with this good Father, who had found him certain Expedients, if not to remove the ſting from his Conſcience, yet at leaſt to lay the pain aſleep, till he had found an Expedient to aſſure theſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to his Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My good Father <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> as amongſt the Bees, ſhe that makes the Honey ſtings moſt ſeverely, ſo now this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58555:61"/>is the more inſupportable from that mouth which hath hitherto diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto me nothing but ſweets and Conſolations; God is my witneſs, that I have never concealed any thing from you, at the Tribunal where accuſing ones ſelf is the beſt excuſe; and if you have not known any thing of me there, it muſt be becauſe I am ignorant of it my ſelf. It is true, I dare not reckon my ſelf for an extraordinary good man; for if I ſhould juſtifie my ſelf, my own mouth would condemn me; and if I have offended God, and ſinned againſt him, it is, that he may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in his ſaying, and what he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: I confeſs, I was born in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me; but yet I have ever loved the truth, by and through which I have accuſed my ſelf of the moſt hidden faults I could remarque, and without fraud or mincing, I have freely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd my ſecrets to you; but if God have by ſome extraordinary means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed any to you, that have ſlipt out of my remembrance, tell it me, and reprove me in the ſpirit of meekneſs and gentleneſs, and I am ready to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

At this preſent, I can boldly ſay, that nothing lies heavy on my heart, but the enjoyment of theſe Church Benefices, without intention of being a Church-man; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that nature, that they may be poſſeſſed by a Secular perſon, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unmarried, and not able to quit them abſolutely, without breach of that reſpect which I owe to my Parents, I think I hold them by no ſuch unjuſt Title; add to this the many conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I have received from you, when I have revealed to you the cauſes of my Scruples; and yet I am ready at the diſpoſition of thoſe from whom I hold what I have, to do any thing that ſhall be adjudged fitting by any ſober and grave Perſons.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Simplicius</hi> thinking that <hi>Alcimus</hi> would dextrouſly thus have warded the blow, and changed his purpoſe, to avoid anſwering to that which he thought he had plainly enough propoſed.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:58555:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>No, no,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Seigneur</hi> Alcimus, <hi>you muſt not thus think to eſcape me, I have fig-leaves in my hands to prevent the gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Snake; I ſhould be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet to ſpeak in this extravagant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that which we have ſo often diſcourſed of before, and which puts me to as much trouble as your ſelf, ſince the Confeſſor and Penitent are both faſtened with the ſame Chain; there is another far different My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, a Myſtery of Iniquity which you have not yet diſcovered, and which is come to my knowledge by a way which you would ſcarce ever divine; and aſſure your ſelf it will be to your good to make a right uſe of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, and to the diſcharge of my Soul if you reject it: what I ſay may ſerve you for correction, if you take it as you ought, and for advertiſement, though you have no deſire to profit by it: Now you muſt know, there is a grand difference, betwixt the Laws poſitive and common, and thoſe that are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; for as men have made the Laws po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, ſo may they diſpenſe with them; but for Divine Ordinances, they are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, and whoever ſeeks excuſes to palliate iniquity, doubles the Crime, and is doubly culpable. For Example, as to the uſe of Eccleſiaſtical goods, the Holy Father, who
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58555:62"/>is Supreme and Sovereign Diſpoſer of them, may favour thoſe with them, whom he judges fit and deſerving; but there is no earthly Authority that can diſpenſe with theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commandments,</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill: Thou ſhalt not ſteal: Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery.</p>
               <p>This the good man ſpake confuſedly, that he might not ſuddenly touch the ſore of him, whom he thought wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To this <hi>Alcimus</hi> reply'd:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Father, If I were as innocent upon the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which you have made touching the poſitive Right, as upon the three laſt Articles of the Divine, which you mentioned, my Soul would enjoy a profound peace, and I ſhould have but little cauſe to doubt of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace: For, as for Murther, my hands are very clear from blood, and I deſire not the death of any man. As for other Men's Goods, I am ſo far from having my hands ſullied with them, or my deſires therewith touched, that thoſe which I already poſſeſs, lie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomewhat too heavy on me. And as for the Wife of another, God preſerve me from deſiring her, ſince I never caſt my eyes upon any lawful Subject, which I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58555:63"/>would be willing to take to my ſelf; and this is the only point of difference that ever happens betwixt me and my Parents, who deſire nothing ſo much as to ſee me married; nor is there any thing I fly from more, being more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of the benefit of the Field, than the confinement of the Cage: And my Soul being thus eſtranged, even from honeſt and lawful affections, what is it from unjuſt and unlawful ones? For, beſides my averſion from all Women in general, I have a particular abhorrency againſt the worſer ſort of them; and as for thoſe that are engaged in Marriage, I cannot have the confidence ſo much as to look on them, for fear, not only of the ſecret adultery of a wanton look, but of violating ſo holy a Sacrament, which is the moſt Sacred Bond of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society.</q>
               </p>

I may juſtly threaten you, if you perſevere in this courſe, to ſhew your impiety to the people, and caſt your ſhame in your own face: conceal not your ſelf ſo vainly therefore, O Infant of my Soul; Prevaricator of the Laws of God: Look back into your own heart, and retake your former Virtue; fall again to your former good Works, and by a ſound Repentance, regain your loſt Robe of Innocence: Return, O</hi> Shunamite <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.

I ſpeak not of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two firſt (<hi>replyed</hi> Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us) nor of the effects of the third, but who knows not that as in good deeds God accepts the will for the deed, ſo evils but deſigned by a determined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, are as much as executed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſince we have to do with a God who ſearcheth the hearts and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reins; before whom all things are open, and nothing hid, who ſeeth our thoughts afar off, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our deſigns before they be diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: he will not hold him innocent, who performs not an evil if he have but once deſigned it; for his own mouth hath declared, that he who looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his neighbour's wife with a luſtful eye, hath committed Adultery with her in his heart already: And to what ſerve all your ſerenades, your pran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings,

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58555:65"/>palpable ones: believe me, your fire cannot burn without ſome ſmoke, and who can keep a fire in his breaſt, and conceal all the ſparks from the ſight of the world: So many corvets and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries are not made without ſome deſign, ſome unhappy one, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, unleſs you take heed of your ſelf, will invelope you in grand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, and though your deſigns may be built up to their full perfection, will at laſt intomb you in your own ruines. I ſpeak this without any other intereſt then the deſire of your good, and fear of your misfortune; I ſhould not love, you if I ſhould diſſemble that which would be ſo prejudicial to you; friendſhip and flattery are two diſtinct things, too remote to be comprehended in the circumference of one breaſt: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, return unto your ſelf, and turn from what is bad, ceaſe from what is evil, and practice what is good: God has given you too good talents both of wit and body, to be miſerably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as upon the ſearch of what is forbidden by the giver, and the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which cannot be but pernicious to you. Pardon me if by this touch of

                  <p>And think you, <hi>Alcimus,</hi> that adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is a crime to be purged by oaths, or that the crime of perjury (as two

                  </p>
                  <p>Father, <hi>(replyed</hi> Alcimus) I know you ſpeak all this but to eſſay the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of your Penitent, and I wiſh that heaven may never pardon it, but contrarily invent ſome unheard of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for me, ſhowring down all its Anathema's upon my head, if I have knowingly concealed any thing from you, which I thought my ſelf bound in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58555:66"/>conſcience to diſcover, or the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which might in the leaſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me culpable; God preſerve me from ſo double, deceitful and ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a thought, and I do ſolemnly aſſure you, by whatever is moſt ſacred in earth or heaven, that I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon any Woman whatſoever, much leſs upon the Wife of another man. All that I can ſay is, that this muſt either be jealouſie, which often ſees that which is not, or calumny, that has contrived this accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and with which I ſee your ſpirit ſo prepoſſeſt, that unleſs it pleaſe God to interpoſe his hand, I know not how you will ever be diſabuſed: I know the reſpect I owe to your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and how much I am obliged to the wholſome remonſtrances that proceed from your Fatherhood, and whatever you ſhall pleaſe to ſay or do to me, ſhall find a ready obſervance from me, knowing what aſcendant both our ſpiritual and temporal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to have over us: I ſhall only patiently attend, till time (which is the Father of Truth) bring forth light out of darkneſs, and witneſs my

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58555:67"/>into the Grave, when he thought himſelf furtheſt from it; not in the midſt, but even upon the point of his beſt days, by an accident, as miſerable as unſuſpected: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon left him, without ſuffering <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his inſtant entreaties to extract from him a more particular declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <q>This is the property of the jealous (<hi>ſaid</hi> Alcimus) to believe that all things conſpire the ruine of their Honour: the Days, the Nights, the Stars, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the very Animals are ſuſpected by them, much more reaſonable Creatures; they fear where there is not the leaſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſuſpition, the Shadows to them are Subſtances, &amp; their vain Suſpitions pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Convictions, and their falſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations evident and undoubted Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But be pleaſed to tell me <hi>(Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father)</hi> of whom in particular <hi>Capoleon</hi> is jealous; for there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it ſhould be of me, who know his Wife ſo little, that I ſtould not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh her amongſt a Troop of others. I have ſeen her amongſt other young Ladies before ſhe was made his; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her only as an Object which never obliged me to a particular regard: I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58555:72"/>think I have ſeen her too amongſt other women ſince her Marriage, whilſt ſhe appeared in Companies; but ſince her Husband has given her <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Ring, and by a ſtreit Impriſonment has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her inviſible, even to the Eyes of Heaven, certainly I muſt have more than a <hi>Lynx</hi> his ſight, to penetrate thoſe Walls which incloſe her: If the good Mans Feaver burn only on this ſide, it is very eaſie to be healed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Simplicius</hi> believing that <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſtill perſiſted in his diſſimulation, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his voice with a more ſtrong and piercing Tone than formerly, with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent impetuoſity, vehemence of ſpirit, he ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do you conſider what it is you do, or that you ſtand in the preſence of an Almighty God? Or have you ever read or heard of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Judgment that light upon</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Saphira; <hi>it is not now a mortal man, but an Eternal God that you impoſe upon:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he began to uſe the Word, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, with opportunity, and even with importunity, to reprove, pray, conjure, to cry in all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſoundneſs of Doctrine: Have you forgot</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that the excuſe of</hi> Adam, <hi>and that of</hi> Cain, <hi>were worſe than their

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this I underſtand</hi> (reply'd <hi>Alcimus) that</hi> Capoleon <hi>is jealous of me, thinking that my paſſages and managements in his ſtreet, and ſometimes before his Gate, are Incenſe and Perfumes which I offer to that Idol, which ought to be adored by none but himſelf. O God! was ever ſeen ſuch a profound diſſimulation? I can affirm, that there is no perſon, I will not ſay, in that Quarter, but even in the whole Town, that has ſo much applauded me upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as himſelf, nor any that has ſo much puffed up my fancy thereby. To whom hereafter ſhall we truſt? ſince by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and careſſes one is ſo baſely deceived? Certainly, the Wiſe man ſpoke with much reaſon, when he ſaid,</hi> My Son, thoſe that feed thee with fair ſpeeches and artificial
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58555:73"/>prayſes, are thoſe that do decline or would ſeduce thee: <hi>But this man has given me as juſt cauſe for the future to diſtruſt him, as his was unjuſt for ſuſpecting me, who had never the leaſt thought of attempting the Honour of his Wife, whom I hold to be as virtuous as fair: And if my judgment fail me not, worthy of a better chance than falling into his cruel hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My dear Father</hi> (continued he) <hi>I give you my humbleſt thanks for your charitable admonition, and promiſe you for the future to ſtand upon my guard, and to cauſe (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to my Honour) that he ſhall loſe his evil opinion of me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Simplicius</hi> then ſeeing that the Maſque was taken off, and that it was now time to ſpeak plainly, proteſted to him (as the truth was) that <hi>Capoleon</hi> had never ſpoke word to him of this Affair, but that he had learnt it from a pious Soul (for ſuch he eſteemed <hi>Vannoza</hi> to be) and one deſirous both of his temporal and eternal welfare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father</hi> (ſaid <hi>Alcimus) It is a thing ſo ſhameful to a jealous Husband to diſcover his own baſeneſs, that I believe</hi> Capoleon <hi>would not make you this report himſelf; but has for that purpoſe made uſe of a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who under the pretext of Piety (a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58555:73"/>which opens the ears and hearts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Souls) has informed you of this falſe relation, to the prejudice of Truth, and the ſincerity of my own Conſcience: I ſtand here in the preſence of God, and in a place where I had rather die, than be like</hi> Ananias; <hi>but I do aſſure you, and ſacredly affirm upon the ſalvation of my Soul (which I value as a good Chriſtian ought) that I never had any adulterous deſign upon the Wife of</hi> Capole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>and of this you may aſſure this charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul; and withal (leſt I ſhould leave any of my Honour diſadvantageouſly engaged) that if I were as well aſſured of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as little afraid of the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as I am of the weak efforts of the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous-pated</hi> Capoleon, <hi>I might well put my ſelf into the number of the Elect; and I fear not, but by Gods aſſiſtance, to ſhelter my ſelf, not only from his menaces, but alſo from the wicked and pernicious effects of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and vain ſuſpicion; I would gladly love him, becauſe God has commanded it, but will alſo endeavour to ſafe my ſelf from the ſurprize of ſo treacherous an Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simplicius</hi> judging by theſe words of this Gentleman, whoſe heart he had long known the very ſecrets of, that he ſpoke the real truth, and that with an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58555:74"/>Charity he accuſed himſelf of that in which he found himſelf innocent; would inſiſt no longer upon that ſubject, for fear of drawing blood from the nipple or the noſe, by too much ſucking the one, or wringing the other, and imagining that <hi>Vannoza</hi> had diſcovered to him the real Jealouſy of her Husband, founded upon the falſe opinion of <hi>Alcimus</hi> his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, he contented himſelf with what his Penitent had already diſcover'd; but to prevent all future miſhaps, and to pluck up by the roots the hatred from his heart which he had conceived againſt <hi>Capoleon,</hi> whom he had already named his Enemy, (a word of war and defiance in this ſplee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natique Country) he again proteſted to him, that <hi>Capoleon</hi> neither by himſelf nor Deputy had given him this advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or made theſe menaces, but that it was a religious and timorous Soul, which perhaps had too far exaggerated the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and according to the Proverb, had painted the Lyon fiercer than he was; that he deſired him not to look upon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poleon</hi> with the worſe eye for this, nor to do any thing, further to promote his Malady, which was of the nature of thoſe artificial Fires, which every thing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58555:74"/>would nouriſh; but nothing extinguiſh: That he ought to have compaſſion of ſuch infirmities of ſpirit, according to the Apoſtles advice, who would that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Perſons, and thoſe who are fortified within, ſhould bear with greater forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and patience the faults and inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the weak, to accompliſh the Law, which would that we ſhould bear with one another's infirmities: Adding, that the only remedy he perceived for this miſunderſtanding, was to abſtain for the future from theſe paſſes in the Street, at leaſt till time with his inſenſible Spunge had effaced from the ſpirit of this offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Husband the impreſſions which his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil humour might perhaps have engraved there, it being no part of a prudent man to exaſperate the Waſp, or to provoke the Bee; which laſt though naturally of a ſweet and gentle temper, as being born and bred amongſt Honey, knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how to manage its Sting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend its Comb: And further, That a true Penitent was not only oblig'd to part from the Territories, but from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Evil; for to what purpoſe is it to quit the unfortunate City of Iniquity, and take up Quarters in the Suburbs?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58555:75"/>I mean within thoſe of the occaſions of Evil, to fly to <hi>Zoar</hi> and look back to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> It is not enough for the true <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> to drink no Wine nor ſtrong Drink, unleſs they alſo abſtain too from the very Grape, leaſt the taſte of the one breed a deſire of the other. With theſe Reaſons <hi>Simplicius</hi> ſtrengthened his Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without aſſuming the power of commanding, but certainly with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel accompanied with the Spirit of God, he advis'd <hi>Alcimus</hi> to turn away his courſe from the frequentation

                  </q> 
                  <hi>Alcimus</hi> found it very difficult to ſubmit to theſe Injunctions, alledging that the Laws of Cloiſters and thoſe of the World were very far different; that the one preſcribed to honour a blind ſubmiſſion, and a renunciation of all Earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but that in the World it was one of the greateſt marks of Infamy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Laws from the will of the Enemy; and that

Remember</hi> Saul<hi>'s maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for diſobeying</hi> Samuel; <hi>t'is a Crime, to disbelieve, but a kind of Witchcraft to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey; to ſpeak plainly, you would hereby perſwade me to that which I am unwilling to believe, and under pretext of oppoſing your wrath to the hatred of the Husband, make me ſuſpect a ſecret affection for the Wife: For,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Who often'ſt ſaith I hate, does prove</l>

                  </q> 
                  <hi>Moreover, you are bound in Conſcience to give no occaſion of offence or ſcandal in your deportments; for if the great Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58555:76"/>that he would eat no fleſh ſo long as he lived, rather than by eating to offend the weakeſt of his Brethren; How much more ought you to avoid the Actions and Occaſions which might give ſuſpicion of the works of the fleſh, unjuſtly deſired or purſued after? And if the ſame Apoſtle would not that the leaſt mention of Fornication ſhould be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, how much more odious and deteſtable ought Adultery to be, either in action or affection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father</hi> (ſaid <hi>Alcimus) your diſcourſes are backt with Reaſon, and ſpeak you both a Chriſtian and Religious Perſon; but be pleas'd to conſider, that I am not of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, but yet a Chriſtian like you, although a ſecular and mundain one; and though there be no more agreement betwixt the rules of Piety and thoſe of the World, than betwixt light and darkneſs, the Ark and</hi> Dagon, <hi>or God and Mammon, yet are we obliged in performing the one, not to omit the other, if we intend to preſerve our Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, without which we render our ſelves the reproach of the World, and the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject dregs or ſcum of the People. Conſider that I am now a Sword-man, and that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudying Caſes of Conſcience, I have learnt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58555:76"/>that when an Enemy ſhall attacque me, I am not bound to fly, and ſave my life with the loſs of my Honour; and though the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical precept of turning the other cheek to him that ſmites him on the one, extend its ſelf to ſecular perſons as well as regular, yet we ſee it otherwiſe practiſed by both: Our bleſſed Saviour asked that Wretch who ſhamefully ſtruck him, Why he did ſo? and though he did not call Legions of Angels to his ſuccour, or employed Thunder and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts to revenge ſuch injuries (as he might have done) yet did he mix this point of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongſt his admirable meekneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable humility. If</hi> Capoleon <hi>attack me, I think it will be lawful to reſiſt him, and perhaps with the ſame weapons I ſhall turn the miſchief upon him, which he deſigned for me, and confound this Conjurer with his own Devil; for I am reſolved not to ſuffer my ſelf to be aſſaſſinated by his treacherous hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Simplicius</hi> interrupted this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, fearing that if he let <hi>Alcimus</hi> proceed, he would excite that choler in himſelf which he ſhould be ill troubled to allay, and perhaps according to the prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitude of his youthful inclination, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at laſt from words to execution: He
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58555:77"/>therefore ſmooth'd and flatter'd this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous courage, proteſting (indeed too truly) <hi>Capoleons</hi> innocence, and that the report which had been made him, might perhaps be falſe (too truly falſe) but that this his Paternal zeal and care made him not only worthy of Pardon, but of Praiſe and Affection; ſaying, <hi>O Alcimus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus, you know not what it is to be a Father, a ſpiritual Father, had you but experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how the bowels of the Soul yern after the Infants of the Spirit, you might be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge of that ardour which made thoſe words boyl over from the mouths of</hi> Moſes <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>when they deſired to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed for the good of their dear Children and Brethren in righteouſneſs; the day will come when you will know this verity, and look upon that in me with a good eye, which perhaps does now appear otherwiſe to you.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Your heart, dear Father</hi> (anſwer'd <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus) is too right towards me, to do or ſay any thing amiſs; what ever comes from you to me can never be received otherwiſe than well; but withal, I once more intreat you not to condemn me without hearing, for judgment without preindication, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice without judgment is the high way to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58555:77"/>it is eaſie to impeach, but not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; to ſay, not to produce witneſſes; to declare, but not to prove; if accuſing will ſuffice, who can be innocent, what ſhelter for the good, if the ſtorms of the wicked be Oracles.

                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:58555:78"/>And principally for ſome days to avoid his accuſtommed paſſages in that ſtreet; and at laſt by much conjuring and intreaty he extorted this Promiſe, rather violently from his mouth, than voluntarily from his heart; this was not the firſt and free drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the Myrrhe; but rather the ſecond gathering, extracted from the Tree, by ſcratching it with Iron Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcimus</hi> left <hi>Simplicius,</hi> more ſatisfied with his having diſabuſed him, than with his ſimplicity in ſo ſlightly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the report; and troubled withal, that he could not learn from him whence he had had this advice; for he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſuſpected any perſon in the world, than <hi>Vannoza,</hi> whom he held for dead amongſt its obſcurities. In what darkneſs and ignorance do we ſpin out the thread of a frail life!</p>
               <p>Mean while <hi>Vannoza,</hi> who ſleeps lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the Devil much leſs, are hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchiefs on all hands; for whilſt the one as ſubtle as invinſible, blows wrath and malice into the ears of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> the other as dangerous as viſible, preſents her ſelf to thoſe of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> to know the ſucceſs of her falſe report; for it was her principal deſign (like another <hi>Eve</hi>)
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58555:78"/>to open the eyes of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> by taſting the forbidden Fruit, and to procure him to look diligently in his paſſage towards every part of her houſe, from whence he was otherwiſe regarded than ſhe pretended, he ſuſpected, or <hi>Simplicius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; that ſhe might thereby find means to make ſigns to him, as Veſſels ſtuck faſt upon a Shelve, or in other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, do for help to thoſe Ships that paſs by. But ſhe was infinitely aſtoniſh'd, when ſhe found by Father <hi>Simplicius</hi> his recital, that ſhe had ruined her own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and wounded her ſelf by her own Weapon, and by an ill-temper'd Plaiſter, brought her Sore from an Ulcer to a Gangrene; and further when ſhe learnt that <hi>Alcimus</hi> had not the leaſt thought or affection for her; this conſideration made her deſpair of ſucceſs; but to thoſe who are irremediably overthrown, it is a kind of comfort that they can fear no further miſchief: She took new vigour, when ſhe underſtood from <hi>Simplicius</hi> the indifferency he had for all her Sex, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the purity and whiteneſs of this Paper would eaſily be ſuſceptible of the firſt impreſſion, and that this green Wood once lighted, would burn moſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58555:79"/>fiercely; Love being a Myſtery, in which the Apprentices are Maſters; She begun to project new Deſignes how to bring down that untamed Courage, which was yet proof againſt all Loves Aſſaults; and to recal this wild and untaught Hawk to the Lure; At preſent ſhe only told <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius,</hi> that his Monaſtick life and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous innocence, rendred him leſs ſubtle in ſearching into the ſecrets of the heart, and the ſpiritual wickedneſs of worldly thoughts; and of thoſe, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of affection, make it their glory to deceive: believing that Heaven laughs at their Perjuries and Oaths, which are only writ on running waters; who hold for a Maxime, That Love, Wine, and Secrets are worth nothing when they have taken the Air; and that it ſeemed in our Age, men had effaced this practice from the number of ſins; it being not only common but commendable: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was the ſhuttle-cock of Courts, but the ruinous Arrow of hearts; ſhe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wiſht him to beware of a ſurprize, and ſince he had drawn from <hi>Alcimus</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not to paſs through that quarter of a good while, that he ſhould take care that he found a firm performance and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58555:79"/>long continuance. See here how this ſubtile crafty Female ſpoke what was as far from her deſire as intention. In the mean time having painted her face with a lively joy, ſhe returned home rather dead than living, with ſadneſs ſo deeply rooted in her Soul, or rather her Soul ſo deeply plunged in ſorrow, that ſhe knew not whether it were fitteſt to reckon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt the dead or living. She had now loſt the ſight of her North-Star, her days were now become but nights, and the very ſight of the Sun was diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; overwhelm'd with ſadneſs, ſorrow, and melancholy, ſhe did nothing elſe but ſigh and groan like the ſolitary widowed Turtle, bewailing nothing but the loſs of the ſight of her amiable <hi>Alcimus. Was not I</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>ſufficiently miſerable without adding more to my misfortunes? To what new miſchief do the Heavens reſerve me, having thus condemned me to perpetual dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? O thou Light of my Eyes how art thou clouded! thoſe ſhort and little glances of thee which I once enjoyed, did give me ſome ſort of conſolation, but this ſad Eclipſe is inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, which for ever deprives me of ſo dear an Object, and which to me does ſeem the pleaſanteſt in the World; But come

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58555:80"/>her, and on whoſe affection only depended all her contentment. See here the ſubtility of this wicked Woman, who thought by ſowing an irreconcileable quarrel betwixt <hi>Alcimus</hi> and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to heal her paſſion which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the chance fell: for <hi>Alcimus</hi> once ſlain, her flames would be extinguiſht with his funeral Torches, and her inſupportable Paſſion buried in his Grave; but if <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poleon</hi> ſhould fall under his misfortune, ſhe ſaw her way made plain over his Grave to the end of her deſigns, and by her Widowhood put into poſſeſſion of her ſelf, and left to a free purſuit after the ſatisfaction of her ardent deſires. A ſtrange fetch of female ſubtility. But ſtill ſhe diſſembled her thoughts, and made no outward ſhew but of Sadneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as if theſe two qualities were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, and thereby ſhe ſunk deeper into her Husband's belief the opinion that it was only her Devotion that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this Melancholy; and the truth is, a feigned, falſe, conſtrained Piety (if ſuch deep Hypocriſie may bear ſo fair a Title) does oftentimes ingender this ſort of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is begot by the interiour worm of a cauteriz'd Conſcience, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58555:81"/>does inceſſantly gnaw upon the heart: She was however much pleaſed to ſee her old Man ſo much concerned at her ſeeming Melancholy; and the more he ſeem'd to be troubled at it, the more cauſe ſhe ſtill gave him to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Whileſt ſhe ſo dully paſt her time, like a Hunter upon a cold Scent, the Devil, who like a roaring Lyon, has his eyes and mouth ſtill open for a prey, way-laying his ſtratagems in the ſpirit of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> and fanning his deluſions into his head, and ſo diligently blew up this ſpark of anger which he had againſt <hi>Capoleon,</hi> that at laſt he ſtirred up a devouring flame in his heart; He repreſented to him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable Age, and ridiculous weakneſs of his Enemy, together with the baſe puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity of fearing ſo inconſiderable an Antagoniſt, who was ſo far below his birth and quality; that he would dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from both, if he did not turn his treacherous deſigns upon his own head, who durſt not have undertaken ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous enterprizes, had he not believed that he who ought to be a Gentleman of courage and gallantry, had quitted both for the Counſel of a timerous Monk; that theſe Cloiſter-ſpirits are never ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58555:81"/>of generous reſolutions, that like Reeds, they cannot reſiſt a Tempeſt but by compliance; that gallant Souls ought to imitate the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> that can be ſhaken by nought but thunder; that going out well accompanied, he might bid defiance to his Enemy, and paſs his Horſes hoofs over his belly, if he durſt aſſault him; that there needed nothing but a good Armour to defend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt treachery, and that he ought to embrace ſuch occurrences which might manifeſt his courage and gallantry; for amongſt Men of the Sword, nothing but danger can ſhew what a Man is made of: Theſe were the Remonſtrances of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy both of his Soul and Body, who ſeemed ſo diligent a Preſerver of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the one, and the ſafety of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though his deſign was only to bring them both to deſtruction. <hi>Alcimus</hi> puft up by the vanity of theſe thoughts, did like the Lyon ſtir up his rage by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own ſides, and fancying to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his imaginary Enemy would too gloriouſly triumph at his too eaſy retreat, if upon the meer advertiſement of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Father, he forced himſelf to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour a jealous Coxcomb, thoſe few days

                  </gap>t: <hi>David,</hi> of old, a King ſo Holy, and (till then) ſo innocent, looking from the lofty top of his Palace, ſaw within a Garden a Bird, or rather a Fiſh within a Fountain, which at one glance of the Eye foiled all his holy reſolutions to the ground: <hi>Alcimus</hi> who was made of no better a mould, looking up from the ſtreet, and expecting nothing but the levelling of a <hi>Harquebuz</hi> at his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, felt the blow of a more dangerous one than he expected, I mean a <hi>Baſilisk</hi>'s Eyes in a beautious face, which ſoon grinded to duſt all his Virtuous intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: During this interview he made his Horſe corvet and bound, and exerciſed all his moſt excellent poſtures; till ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many attractious circumſcribed in ſo ſmall a compaſs, and ſo many charms contracted in one face, he thought the windows of Heaven had been opened, and that he ſaw not a Star, but rather an Angel or beauty of Paradiſe; For <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noza</hi> appeared in ſuch an equipage as was capable to make an impreſſion upon
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58555:83"/>the beſt fenced heart of a young Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier principally on one which lay expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the airy paſſions, which make them prefer a ſhameful ſlavery before a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty. Why ſhould I trouble my ſelf to paint out theſe follies? He ſaw and fell, and <hi>Vannoza</hi> might as juſtly as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> bear the Motto of, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Viſi,</hi> upon her Triumphant Banners. <hi>Alcimus</hi> was not ſo much a novice but he knew the Language of his own Country, which is that of love, and knew well enough that it ſignified that he was better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in that houſe then he expected, and that the hatred of the Husband was ſufficiently balanced by the affection of the Wife; And as love is the onely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of love, beſides ſo many charms that rendred this beauty recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he thought himſelf obliged in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to render a reciprocal affection, ſo that he quickly anſwer'd her in her own language, which ſomewhat reſembled that of Angels, or rather of Demons, which ſpeak to one another in thoughts, and there needed no Interpreter to make them underſtand one another; thus paſſed this firſt interview. The next day the Sun had ſcarce begun by bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58555:84"/>Weſtward to lengthen the ſhadows, when <hi>Alcimus</hi> (whoſe coming was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by his faithful Sentinel long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his approach) returned to his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al practice, to draw in through his Eyes the poyſon, not of hatred but of love, a paſſion more pernicious to his Heart, where he ſaw her hold up a letter in her hand, with ſign to come and receive it at night, which he diligently perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with no other company then his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; ſee here the firſt thread of this Web of iniquity which theſe two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders went craftily to weave.

All he could ſay, was, That he was a young Cavalier, and ſo head-ſtrong, that it was hard for a holy Father to guide him by the Bridle of Religion: That if <hi>Capoleon</hi> attacque him, he will bring himſelf in danger of undergoing a great part of the miſchief.

                  <hi>Simplicius</hi> from a well-meaning heart,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58555:88"/>not only approved, but highly praiſed this deſign, being much rejoyced to ſee the Scorpion's Oyl prepared to cure the ſting; and then <hi>Vannoza</hi> by this means, cutting off all hope, would thereby take away all occaſions of his continuance in his fond Amours: He therefore promis'd to confront her with him; that this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> taken in the fact (if I may ſo ſay) and convinced in his preſence, might ſeek no further pretexts or palliations to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his iniquity. And ſo forward was this good Man in this deſign, thinking therein to do all things for the beſt, and believing that all would paſs under the Seal of ſecreſie, that he judged this fitteſt to be done at the very Confeſſional, which according to common Cuſtome, having two places for the Penitents, and one in the middle for the Confeſſor, he might thereby more expreſly convince the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, himſelf being preſent at the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. But (O execrable Invention!) ſhe fearing leaſt her Invention might turn to her own confuſion, deſired this good Father, that ſhe might a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have one moments conference with <hi>Alcimus,</hi> promiſing thereby more gently to compoſe his ſpirit to an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58555:88"/>of his fault, leſt being ſurprized on the ſudden, he might fly out into ſome extravagant recrimination, or poſitive denial: The good opinion which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had of this Female Hypocrite, made him approve well of her Popoſition; in ſo much that he appointed a day for this rencounter, before which he told <hi>Alcimus,</hi> that the relation came from <hi>Vannoza</hi> her ſelf, which would witneſs his falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to his face: Provided ſhe lift up her Veil (ſaid <hi>Alcimus</hi>) I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent you will find hers overſpread with bluſhes, if there remain in her the leaſt quantity of blood: With which words the Conference ended; and they parted till the appointed day of meeting ſhould come.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Seigneur</hi> Alcimus, <hi>You will perhaps won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the many ſubtleties I have uſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque you, but Neceſſity, the Miſtreſs of Invention was furniſhed with Artifices, which opened me the way. Know then, and aſſure your ſelf, it was only I, who by means of this holy Father, gave you this falſe alarm of the imaginary jealouſie of my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of you, I ſay, imaginary as to you, for his jealouſie being notorious through all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I durſt not in general terms ſtile it feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it is ſo univerſal, that without pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon you, or any other in particular, it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58555:90"/>extends to all the world; he muſt be a ſtranger in this Town, who knows not the evil uſage which that hath cauſed me, and my long and cloſe Impriſonment, is a ſubject of ſorrow to all that hear of it; it is natural to the ſmalleſt Bird to ſearch about her Cage for a hole to eſcape from ſlavery, which I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to obtain, or loſe my life in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which is but a burthen, wanting my liberty; I know how little worth or merit I have to work the leaſt affection in you, yet have I miſeries enough to ſtir up a pity in your generous Breaſt, ſo that what I cannot hope for from your paſſion, I almoſt aſſure my ſelf from your compaſſion; for this gives ſo puiſſant a ſentiment to the braveſt Courages, that they make it their glory to be that way vanquiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d; for this makes their Valour victorious over others miſeries, as conſtancy makes them over their own: For what would become of the miſerable and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed without the aſſiſtance of generous Cavaliers of your Quality and Merits. I have therefore caſt my eyes upon you as upon a Gentleman full of Honour, to the end that throwing my ſelf at your feet, or into the arms of your pity, in caſe your goodneſs prove favourable to my miſery, I may by that means find an iſſue out of my deplorable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58555:91"/>before I try the laſt remedy, which is death.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Which to all ſufferings an end does give,</l>
                     <l>And makes the moſt unhappy ceaſe to grieve.</l>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>This is a Cure which the miſerableſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alive may obtain, and then defy the worſt of Fortune's ſtrokes: I have here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time nor leiſure to let you underſtand the unjuſt rigours which</hi> Capoleon <hi>has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed againſt my innocence, and how inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently his cruelty does triumph over my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: 'Tis enough to tell you, that I implore your aſſiſtance to deliver me from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſeries, by what means you ſhall think moſt convenient; and 'tis eaſie for you to advance this Stratagem, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready invented, having infuſed into the Soul of your Confeſſor (a man of a true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick ſimplicity) a fear of the dreadful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of</hi> Capoleon<hi>'s fury, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find entrance into your magnanimous Courage, if it were real; but I aſſure you, that my Husband does not ſo much as think of you; or if he either think or ſpeak of you, it is rather with eſteem and praiſe, than
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58555:91"/>otherwiſe; and further, I find that he takes a ſingular pleaſure in ſeeing you on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, but imagines not how far I participate with him in it; for the place from whence I behold you is a ſecret one, frequented by none but my ſelf, and to which I go by private ways, to give this incomparable contentment to my eyes, to behold amidst thoſe noble and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Actions, the moſt compleat and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Cavalier living. I have (in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this firſt impreſſion) made Father</hi> Simplicius <hi>believe that you purſued me with your Courtſhip (though convinced how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided I am of graces and attractions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to merit it) and further, that in the ſtreet you gave evident teſtimonies of your love, but this was only to ſet a more ſpecious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour on my Husbands jealouſie. To ſum up all, all this deſign tended only to this ſole point of happineſs I now poſſeſs, (but, alas! with what brevity) to repreſent unto your view a ſcantling of miſeries, which is ſo great an alleviation to them, that I never enjoyed a greater happineſs amongſt all the paſſages of my life: For, I know by ſad experience that nothing ſo much oppreſſeth the heart, as not to know where to unload its ſorrow; and the moſt miſerable of all griefs, is that which wants a voice for complaints: 'Tis at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58555:92"/>to you, Gentle</hi> Alcimus, <hi>and to that courteſie and generoſity, ſo natural to thoſe of your Rank and Quality, that I now fly for help and advice; and for what ſuccour you ſhall pleaſe to lend unto my pain, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall come from your hand ſhall be highly acceptable; for ſince your merits and my own inclination have forced me upon a reſolution of carrying the love of you along with me to my Grave; I am ready to commit my Perſon, Fortune, Life, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to your generous Protection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How could ſhe more openly, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed immodeſtly, have explained her ſelf? But who knows not that impudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is always followed by impudence? She concluded her Harangue with ſuch languiſhing Looks and Tears, as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to charm the hardeſt rock; and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi> who was not made of Marble, was therewith ſo lively touched, that he did not queſtion but ſhe ſpoke ſincerely, and took her Diſcourſe for no leſs than Oracles; and baniſhing from his ſpirit all ſuſpition of Treaſon, and all fear from <hi>Capaleon's</hi> practices, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſee a heart touched with the love of him, and he not labour of the ſame
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58555:92"/>diſtemper, which is a malady ſooner blamed than avoided, and which is more eaſily avoided by flying it's encounters, than healed where it has once taken foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcimus</hi> vanquiſhed with ſo many cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies and favours, preſently rendred his arms at the feet of the conquerour, and ſuffering himſelf as eaſily as <hi>Sampſon</hi> to be bound and brought to the Mill, he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his ſubmiſſion by words, which ſhewed him to be a deeper Student in Rhetorick than <hi>Vannoza,</hi> and as great a ſervant to love, offering her for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this truth, all the ſervice which her commands could impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his obedience, ſaying, That to this he was doubly obliged, by the deſire of poſſeſſing ſo rich a treaſure, and by that of redeeming her from ſo tedious a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, a thraldome, which extracted pity from the moſt barbarous hearer: This was to fall inſenſibly into the net of his dangerous huntreſs, whoſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was, That if ſhe had not wrought affection in the heart of this novice in thoſe affairs, to induce him by pity (a ſpecious gate for love to enter at) to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her away out of that deteſtable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58555:93"/>not queſtioning but after that ſhe ſhould have graces and charms enough to work the paſſion of commiſeration into that of affection: and though at laſt ſhe prevailed not ſo far as to make him her captive, yet would this put an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon <hi>Capoleon,</hi> an affront ſo irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this Countrey as nothing can waſh off but the blood of the offender, ſo that ſhe intended at once to ſave her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, her life and liberty, and either enjoy her unjuſt pretenſions, or at leaſt diſcharge her ſelf of the importunity of love or the bonds of marriage. She ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to ſecure her honour by making it be believed (a thing eaſily alledged) that her rape though voluntary, &amp; of her own ſuggeſting, was a forced action, and that <hi>Alcimus</hi> his paſſion, which ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complained of to <hi>Simplicius,</hi> had pricked him on to this raſh adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Her life ſhe thought ſecure betwixt the arms of a Gentleman more puiſſant than her husband; and her liberty, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſecured by this violence; That if <hi>Capoleon</hi> fell in this quarrel, her marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yoke was thereby broken; if <hi>Alcimus,</hi> her love was cured by the removal of the object that gave it being, or at worſt ſhe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58555:93"/>hoped to be reſtored into the hands of her parents, <hi>Capoleon</hi> refuſing her, after having been polluted and poſſeſt by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which every way would free her from ſervitude: but when ſhe ſaw <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi> declare himſelf a lover, and that in ſo high a degree, with an ingenuity witneſſed both by his words and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then taking him for captive, and her ſelf victorious, and hapilpy arrived at the end of her chief pretenſions, ſhe ſaw her ſelf freed from the trouble of coming to further extremities, and that inſtead of ſounding the trumpet and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king open war (which would occaſion more noiſe than advantage to her) ſhe might now go more privately to work, and put crafts and ſubtilties (the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſource of this infamous paſſion) in the place of force and violence. Now as women guarded and kept cloſe by jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous husbands, oft work their liberty out of thoſe guards that are ſet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, eighter by dazzling their eyes by artifices and cajolleries, or by the bribes of gold and ſilver, which is more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating than lightning, ſo this ſubtle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man found it the beſt means to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a correſpondence with <hi>Alcimus,</hi> by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58555:94"/>his means whoſe chief ſtudy it was to prevent it, by working upon the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſimplicity of this holy Father, and uſing the Leaves of devotion to conceal the nakedneſs of her execrable impiety; as ſhe projected ſo ſhe ſpoke, and no ſooner ſpoke but it was aſſented to by this heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs bird, who run head long into the nets and bird-lime laid to ſurprize him: O God! what black crimes do's he ſubmit to, enough to preſs him down alive into the lower Regions, ſuch as Hell it's ſelf would be troubled to invent, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with horrour to commit: he that ſaid, to him that liveth, and to him that deſireth nothing is impoſſible, knew well the force of this paſſion the Queen of all the reſt; but he that painted it blind was in the right too, for it blindly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates into enormous crimes thoſe that commit themſelves unto it's conduct, and ſuch as they would never commit if they gave but any time to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is a navigation where one ſails amongſt thouſands of rocks, ſubject to as many ſtorms and tempeſts, the cauſes of many dreadful ſhip-wracks, and as a hunter, violently ſet upon the ſport, pricked on by that heat is carryed in a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58555:94"/>full carrier, to ſuch rugged and almoſt inacceſſible wayes, as the very ſight of them in cold blood would ſtrike a horror into him; ſo this paſſion of love inſpires ſuch courage into him whom it has throughly poſſeſt, that he dare undertake the hardeſt enterprize, and to content a brutiſh and inordinate appetite, will vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all laws divine and humane, and prophane whatever is moſt holy in earth or heaven. <hi>Alcimus</hi> thus conſented to theſe unlawful projects, like another <hi>Adam</hi> in compliance with his <hi>Eve,</hi> and as <hi>Solomon,</hi> a far wiſer man than himſelf, gave himſelf ſo over to the love of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan-women, that they induced him to the worſhip of what Idols they propoſed to him, to all the artificial inventions that the impiouſly-ſubtle <hi>Vannoza</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected were faithfully (according to the fleſh, but faithleſsly as to the ſpirit) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted and accepted by him: And now tell me that <hi>Hercules,</hi> when governed by women did not ſpin amongſt them, or that <hi>Achilles</hi> was not ſo effeminate as to live diſguiſed amongſt Ladies, ſince <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus,</hi> who alwayes before was an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides Alexicaces,</hi> whileſt animated by a better Genius, is now ſo far transformed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58555:95"/>that he is rather a breeder than a tamer of Monſters, the firſt of which was this: He conſpired with this crafty woman to deceive the charitable innocence of this good Father, and inſtead of making him the mediatour for their reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, and to receive from his mouth the law of the moſt high, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miniſtring Angel of the Lord of Hoſts, they made him the Pandour to their deſigns, and more then Diabolical Stratagems, without his thoughts or ſuſpition of it. <hi>Vannoza</hi> adviſed him to acknowledge that he was formerly enamoured on her, but that he hoped in time, by the aſſiſtance of his fatherly advice and wholeſome inſtructions to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face this affection from his ſoul, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf vanquiſht by her preſence, and as much recalled to repentance by her reaſons, as before overcome by the pleaſing force and violence of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: whereupon they invented di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of intelligence, as filthy and abominable, as crafty and ſecret, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to underſtand one another by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary report of the harmleſs <hi>Simplicius;</hi> inventions, which I am loth to commit to this Paper, for fear of ſullying it with
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:58555:95"/>ſuch a Monopoly of ingroſſed miſchiefs better kept ſecret than revealed, leaſt whileſt I ſtrive to breed an abhorrency againſt them, in the Reader, I may give occaſion to ſome ill-qualified ones of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or at leaſt ſubject of murmur and evil-ſpeaking, and matter of ſcandal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than edification: See here how there is nothing ſo holy as to reſiſt their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, behold confeſſion changed into confuſion by theſe brutiſh ſpirits, whoſe diſtemper was grown to ſo dangerous a malignity, as to turn the antidote into poiſon, and make that remedy plant new vices which was deſigned to root out and extirpiate the old ones.</p>

                  <hi>Father</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I beg of God and you a thouſand pardons, for having hitherto gone about to deceive you; I was indeed the firſt my ſelf that was ſo, by the ſplendour of a beauty whoſe puiſſant ſweetneſs is able to beat down all oppoſition, and therefore in that ſubjugation, I thought my ſelf more worthy of excuſe than accuſation, of pardon than reproach, but now you have turned the Sun into my face, I muſt ſurrender up my arms
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58555:96"/>to truth, whoſe ſtrength is prevalent over all things, like an impetuous torrent, bearing down all before it. The clouds may for ſome time intercept, but never extinguiſh the Sun's rayes, truth may for ſome time be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velloped with the umbrages of divers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, but can never be altogether obſcured. You have ſo well managed your diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that finally by confronting me with an irreproachable Witneſs, you have totally convinced me, but with a happy conviction, ſince this is a tribunal of clemency and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, where even the ſin of</hi> Judas <hi>(of which mine is the image, having ſo often betrayed the divine bounty by a kiſs) is remiſſible: Did you (Father) but contemplate the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous cauſe of ſo miſerable an effect, I am confident as you now think me fooliſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, to ſubmit my ſelf to the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the charms of unlawful love, you would then think me ſtupid and inſenſible, if before ſuch a fire I ſhould endure without heat or flame; but be pleaſed to conſider that our affections (principally thoſe that are grown inveterate) are not put off ſo eaſily as a garment: Would God we could as eaſily quit our habitudes as our habits, as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians caſt all they had, even to their garments, at the Apoſtle's feet, ſo I
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58555:97"/>had preſently depoſited at yours all the paſſion that I had for this Lady.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58555:102"/>by the aid of an amiable light, ſo contrarily, he walks in darkneſs whoſe eyes are clouded; and how ſhould our Spiritual Guides conduct us rightly through a holy diſcipline, if we do not truly and ſincerely diſcover our ſelves to them, without diſguiſing and deceit; for which cauſe the wiſe man declareth that the Heart is deceitful above all things, and a double Tongue is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before God: I will not here make regiſter of the execrable ſubtleties of theſe fire-brands of Hell, of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to one another by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Interpreter, of whom one may ſay, as <hi>David</hi> did of the Patriarch <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, That he heard a Language which he had no underſtanding of;</hi> but is the fault in the Sword if one commit Murther with it? or of a Sacrament if many abuſe it? Who knows not the corrupt Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs turn the beſt Meat into Crudities? Beſides all this, the counter-ſence of their words as well in Speech as Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; their cabaliſtique Cyphers, and interlined Letters, written by a Liquor, which of inviſible became viſible by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held againſt the Fire, and by ſuch like means; and many other wayes,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58555:103"/>whereby they dayly maintained their wicked correſpondence, by abuſing in ſo many ſeveral manners the goodneſs of this religious perſon, who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by toſt like a Ball betwixt two skilful Gameſters.</p>
               <p>But if the wicked devices and odious ſins which were acted in the Temple and in holy places by the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> and of <hi>Eli</hi> were ſo ſeverely puniſht by Divine Vengeance, what puniſhment was due to theſe ſacrilegious perſons, who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to violate a Sacrament, which is great and honourable, and by an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Adultery projected and acted by them, but alſo this other holy one, which pronounceth on Earth the Decrees of Heaven, miſerably changing into a crime, that which ought to ſerve them for an inſtruction of juſtification; How oft, like <hi>Uriah,</hi> did they carry in their own Boſoms the ſealed Packets of their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but with as much wickedneſs and deceit as he had of ignorance and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
               <p>But this ſort of Writing and Speaking was not all, the furious paſſion which ſo tormented them, and robbed them of their repoſe was not an evil that could be

Yet our Criminals found this way ſo environed with thorns, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters ſo perillous, their interviews ſo ſhort, and their converſations ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious, that though the Roſes of this Paſſion ſeem not delicious, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch picquant difficulties, yet they ſoon left their tract of iniquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe having experimented one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, more eaſie, and more accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their guſt, it ſeemed to them as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58555:106"/>hazardous, as it was in it ſelf horrible and impious: For, beſides that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this Stratagem would expoſe them to publick infamy, and make them hated and hiſs'd at by all, as the God of War and the Black-ſmiths Wiſe amongſt the adulterous Poetical gods, were in the inviſible ſnares; It further ſeemed, that humane Juſtice would hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a puniſhment ſuitably rigorous to ſo enormous a Crime: Their next recourſe was therefore to a Ladder, which <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> having procured to be made of ſilk, and as ſecretly delivered it to <hi>Vannoza</hi> in one of their private Monaſtick meetings, which ſhe in the night, at the appointed hour, faſtened to the Window of the room of her pretended Devotion, and caſt down the other end to the ground, where by his activity readily getting over the Walls of the Court-yard, eaſily mounted to the higheſt Pinacle of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended happineſs, without fearing a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice into the horrible depths of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, any more than that of his body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pavement, not thinking of the former, ſince he could eſcape the later by his ſtrength and nimbleneſs.</p>

And if Covetouſneſs be called Idolatry, and Gluttons are ſaid to make a God of their Belly, how much more fitly may we term ſenſual Perſons, Idolaters; who ſeem to acknowledge no other Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the object of their filthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; like unclean Beaſts, wallowing in the mire, looſely abandoning the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Creator (who is the ſole diſpoſer of infinite Delectations) for that of a vile and wretched Creature; for as he that adheres to God, becomes of the ſame Spirit with him; ſo he that ſticks unto a looſe Woman, becomes a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her Body, and of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſo that they reſemble two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who by one Chain are conducted

                  <hi>Alcimus</hi> always went in the night to the abode of this deceitful <hi>Siren,</hi> alone and armed, reſolved to ſet upon the firſt that ſhould interrupt his deſigns, but it being impoſſible for him to mount the Ladder with ſo many Arms as he carried, in quitting them, which he left at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58555:108"/>he was ſeized always with a fear of being ſurprized thus unarmed, ſo that that of the Sacred Pages might juſtly be applied to him, <hi>Combats without, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours within.</hi> But if affection ſharpen the underſtanding, how was it poſſible for him to continue blind amongſt ſo many perils as on all parts invironed him?

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is well expreſſed in theſe words of the Royal Prophet, <hi>The fire is fallen, and they have not ſeen the Sun; for when the flames of deſire tyrannize in their Souls, the light of their eye</hi> (that is, their Reaſon) <hi>remains no longer with them, and the faculties of it quite forſake them.</hi>

               <p>The jealous in the exceſs of their love, have this property, to be always ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and conſequently fearful, and even then, when they have leaſt ſubject for it; 'Tis this that baniſheth repoſe from their eye-lids, and cauſes that the juyce of Poppy, which night ſheds upon the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58555:108"/>earth, cannot infuſe ſleep into their eyes; they are always waking, or rather awaking, and the ear, chiefly in the dark, is always open to the leaſt noiſe; ſo that though theſe two uſed all means imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to be neither ſeen nor heard, yet walking in darkneſs, or in the Scripture Phraſe, <hi>groping by the wall, and in eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places,</hi> whoſe Symmetry was leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernible than the reſt of the Building, it was impoſſible but that they muſt make ſome noiſe or ſound, which would eaſily reach a watchful ear. <hi>Vannoza</hi> had oft been advertiſed of this by <hi>Capoleon,</hi> who was troubled that his Wife uſually ſpent a great part of the night in this Garret, in the converſation of the wandring Ghoſts and Goblins of the night, thinking her Devotion had by this time brought her into the Viſions of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> or of St. <hi>Macarius,</hi> and that the Demons ſtrove to interrupt her Prayers. <hi>Vannoza</hi> ſometimes told him it was nothing, and that ſhe was not ſo good as he ſuppoſed, or ſhe deſired; that ſhe was neither in ſo profound Contemplations, nor ſuch deep Extaſies, to give occaſion to the Angels of Darkneſs to envy her Piety, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it by Apparitions or Illuſions.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58555:109"/>Otherwhiles ſhe made him ſome crafty excuſes, alledging, that during the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the night, the leaſt noiſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great; that there are certain Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals which ſtir not abroad but in the dark, principally on the tops of houſes, and alwayes make a rattling and a noiſe; that if ſhe had been of a timerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, her ſolitude had adminiſtred cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes enough of fear; avowing to him that ſhe had often ſeen Fantomes in different faſhions, but that ſhe attributed it to the interruption of her ſpirits, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſight, amongſt the ſhades of night rather than to her vertue or piety. (As if theſe viſits of Satan were marks of the grand merits of ſuch his impious ſervants.) O <hi>Vannoza!</hi> remember that God is not thus mocked with impurity, that if his long ſuffering wink at thee for a time, till thou arrive to ſuch a height of wickedneſs, it is but for thee to take the greater fall.</p>
               <p>The old man prepoſſeſt with a good opinion of the chaſtity of his wife, took her for a Saint, and all ſhe ſaid for Oracles; with which <hi>Alcimus</hi> and ſhe made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſt-time, it furniſhing them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently with laughter. One night amongſt

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58555:110"/>he knocked at the Door, at the ſame time when ſhe was in the poſſeſſion of a Bear in humane ſhape. This knocking ſeem'd to be her knell, expecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than death from her injured Husband; And <hi>Alcimus</hi> thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf betrayed, reſolved to ſell his life at the higheſt rate his Valour could put upon it: at laſt <hi>Vannoza,</hi> not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of an eſcape by the aſſiſtance of the darkneſs, adviſed him to ſlip under the Bed; and ſhe, feigning her ſelf to be aſleep, let <hi>Capoleon</hi> knock a little longer, and after ſtarting up as if affrighted out of ſleep, ſhe asked who it was that came to interrupt her in the midſt of her repoſe: <hi>Capoleon</hi> praiſing God that ſhe was there &amp; ſafe, recounted to her his Dream from point to point: To the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of which they needed to conſult neither <hi>Morpheus</hi> nor <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> for <hi>Alcimus</hi> and <hi>Vannoza</hi> could do it better than either, but knew not whether it gave them more reaſon of fear or laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Capoleon</hi> telling her he was come to ſuccour her, and deſiring her to open the Door, ſhe knew not whether to take it in jeft or earneſt, fearing all this but an invention and counterfeit pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58555:110"/>in order to her deſtruction, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of her and that of her Lover, beating up a thouſand dreadful alarms; At laſt, taking courage from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of danger, <hi>My Dear,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>know'ſt thou not that Dreams are but lyes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions? I wonder that you being ſo wiſe a man, ſhould trouble your ſelf with theſe ſuperſtitions, which you would blame in the weakeſt Woman; pray return to your reſt; I thank you however for your ſuccour, though it be more importunate than opportune; I am in the little Bed which I have placed in this Room, where pray let me alone this night: Capoleon</hi> notwithſtanding urging her to open it, proteſting that he could not ſleep without her amidſt this inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſhe judging by his voice that he was in earneſt, but without any emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of choller, prayed him to ſtay a while till ſhe were a little cloathed to go with him, for that Bed was too ſtrait for them both (too ſtrait indeed for the Husband and Adulterer.) This while ſhe conſulted with <hi>Alcimus</hi> for his eſcape, who to put himſelf in poſture for defence or flight as he ſhould ſee moſt convenient, (fearing leaſt if by ſome ſiniſter accident he ſhould be found under the Bed, it might coſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58555:111"/>him his life before he could get up) thought it fitteſt to get behind the door, which was no ſooner open but <hi>Capoleon,</hi> taking <hi>Vannoza</hi> by the hand, led her away to his Chamber in the dark, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making them both an honourable amends for the fright and trouble he had put them to: <hi>Alcimus</hi> now had time to clothe himſelf and eſcape, applauding in himſelf the wit and courage of <hi>Vanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and bleſſing the good fortune that attends on Lovers, Inſtead of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging (wretched as he was) the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite bounty and goodneſs of God, who by this hazzard he had run (the greateſt imaginable) gave him fair admonition to renounce his abominable wickedneſs and impiety, and by thus ſhewing him the rod, would fright him into an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But alas! his depraved ſpirit and impenitent heart, inſtead of repenting for what was paſt, and amending for the future, ſtrove rather to imitate the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, who having eſcaped the fury of a Tempeſt, which threatned him with manifeſt Ship-wrack, hath ſcarce dryed his Cloathes before he is ſo weary of Land that he is fired with impatience and deſire of imbarking for another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58555:111"/>to try his fortune the ſecond time: As for <hi>Vannoza,</hi> her wickedneſs whetting her invention, and ſharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her induſtry, ſhe made her husband (whom ſhe ſaw beſotted with love of her) believe what ſhe pleaſed, telling him, That after ſome exerciſes of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which without naming he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſatisfied of, finding her ſelf wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, and her ſpirits weakened and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhe was conſtrained to go to reſt, being of opinion, that after having chaſtned her body and brought it into ſervitude, it was not fitting preſently to reſtore it to delights betwixt the arms of her husband, whom at the ſame time ſhe ſweetned with many feigned careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Thus this falſe Female, the more ſweetly ſhe flattered him, the more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe deceived him: This brings into my memory the ſaying of <hi>Uriah</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, That he could not allow himſelf to take his eaſe and pleaſures in the bed of his wife, whileſt his Captain</hi> Joab <hi>was armed in his pavilions:</hi> Thus ended this Adventure, which ſerved but for a whet-ſtone to ſharpen their infamous deſires and brutiſh appetites; The remembrance of a danger vaniſhed with it, and being

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58555:113"/>taking him in the act, would have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed both to his fury. But it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this head-ſtrong young ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be more ſeverely chaſtiſed than by a Fatherly Remonſtrance, to turn him from his evil courſes and bad deſigns, which happened in the manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: This Servant of <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who by his craft had traced out the haunts of this untamed young Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, not having on his lips the Seal of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which <hi>Alexander</hi> fixed upon thoſe of <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> having advertiſed ſome of <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Servants, that they ſhould take care of their Maſter, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Commands to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they ought to follow him afar off, for fear leſt ſome diſaſter ſhould befal him for want of ſuccour; they who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more than the conſervation of him, on whom their fortunes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, quickly accorded to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but it was fit that their eyes ſhould make them certain of what they yet knew nothing of, but by the ear; which having done, and no longer doubting of the certainty of it; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that one night having followed him afar off, and ſeeing him ſtop, they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58555:114"/>made a ſtand, and there ſee him mount his Ladder, whileſt they as his <hi>Corps de Garde,</hi> ſtood Sentinel, and made their Rounds about the ſtreet, he having left his Ladder hanging at the Window (as uſually it did) to attend his return: Mean while it fell out that a Party of <hi>Sbirres</hi> (who are Sergeants and Officers of Juſtice in that Country) who came from the ſearch of ſome Robbers, meeting theſe Perſons in the ſtreet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd them, what buſineſs detained them ſo long out of their Lodgings, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their names, their quality, and abode, and going at the ſame time to ſeize on ſome of them, who gave ſaucy and abuſive anſwers to their interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, there were preſently Swords drawn, blows dealt luſtily about, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſſes luſtily fired (the ordinary Arms of theſe <hi>Sbirres</hi>) a great Cry made, and the Alarm hotly given in that Quarter, ſome crying out Thieves, ſome Fire, ſome Murther, and all was in an uproar, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flocked out of their houſes to ſee what the matter was, and the ſtreet was ſo full of lights, that it ſeemed to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day than night; the Inhabitants aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled from all parts, and <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58555:114"/>Servants went out among the reſt; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poleon</hi> himſelf leaped out of Bed (every one being concerned at a Cry of Thieves or Fire) This Gentleman being one of the Chief men of that Quarter, all flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, and before his houſe, where the Ladder hung for a <hi>Scalado.</hi> Whilſt theſe confuſed Cries, Blows, and Wounds made all ſpeakers &amp; no hearers, the noiſe came to the top of the Houſe, where our two ſolitary Sparrows were lodged: <hi>Alcimus</hi> leaping up, run to the Window (after having habited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as poſſible on the ſudden) and was going to go down by his Ladder. Good God! what an amazing ſight was it for him to ſee all the ſtreet and Court full of people, which ſtood thickeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bottom of his Ladder: Some ſeized on the Arms he had left below, others were coming to ſearch for Thieves in <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s houſe; ſome were complaining of their Wounds, others laying hold on the Priſoners; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all was a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Diſorders. I have no leiſure to deſcribe the fright and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Vannoza,</hi> who ran down to her Husbands Chamber, as if ſhe had been going to execution, or deſcending alive

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58555:115"/>Company into a belief that there were many of them, and that they ſhould find ſharp ſervice in attacquing ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Villains, ſo that their terrour putting them all to flight, he fled and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf pell-mell amongſt the reſt, without ever being known or taken notice of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Vannoza</hi> knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this, and hearing nothing but blows and crys, fancied her ſelf already torn in pieces, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but her death; ſhe knew that in that Country 'twas in vain to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of a Husband for faults like hers; theſe Offences like Treaſon againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not waſht away but with the blood of the guilty, the ſpot; like that of Oyl, not being to be taken out but with the piece; and as it is imprinted in humane nature, to endeavour to prolong it as long as they can, ſhe run down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cellar to hide her ſelf, as if ſhe were willing to go alive to Hell, rather than ſuffer the pains of death; or like a Criminal Veſtal, be put alive into the pit, as a puniſhment fit for her unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Here ſhe might juſtly ſay, as the Reprobates will at the Day of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Aſſizes, <hi>Mountains fall upon us:</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:58555:116"/>with her as with a Traveller, who being in open Fields in a Tempeſt, ſees the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens all on fire with Lightning, hears the Air reſounding with Thunder, ſees the Earth waſhed with the Rain, and beaten by the Hail, and fearing ſo many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Inſtruments of Death bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his head, betakes himſelf to the ſhelter of a well-ſpread Tree, or ſecret Grot; but if a Thunder-bolt come to tear the Earth from under his feet, think but what fright he now endures this moment, which he takes for the laſt of his whole life; ſuch was the dreadful fright of <hi>Vannoza,</hi> too happy <hi>Vannoza,</hi> had ſhe made uſe of theſe Rods of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correction, and if by the fear of God's Judgments, ſhe had been frighted into Goodneſs: But God might well work Prodigies by the Rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it nothing abates <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s courage; there are ſome Souls are ſo depraved, that like Tigres, they grow more fierce by gentle uſage. Lord, with how many pleaſant ingredients of mercy doſt thou temper the bitterneſs of thy Potion of Juſtice! How many warnings doſt thou give to them, who amidſt their Sins have not quite loſt the ſenſe of thy fear, to make
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58555:116"/>them hide themſelves by penitence from the Arrows of thy fierce wrath! This action of <hi>Vannoza's</hi> hiding her ſelf, puts me in mind of that of <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had taſted the forbidden fruit.

               <p>What aſtoniſhing amazment ſeized on <hi>Vannoza,</hi> who ſeeing her ſelf lifted from
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58555:118"/>the depth of deſpair, to the higheſt top of happineſs, could not chooſe but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect its reality, and as a bad conſcience is never in ſecurity, ſhe feared that ſhe was brought to be ſacrificed, as thoſe of old with Muſick and Garlands; But by little and little ſhe reaſſumed her courage, underſtanding by the recital of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture (which every one reported ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his fancy) that <hi>Alcimus</hi> had eſcaped unknown, and paſt amongſt that uproar for one that intended to rob <hi>Capoleon</hi> of his Riches rather than his Honour, nay rather for a troop of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for the wounded ſervant, and thoſe that fled, deceived by the darkneſs of the night and their own fear (which hath the property to make that appear which is not, and to multiply to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity that which hath any thing of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) made this deceit paſs for a verity, none being able to contradict it: <hi>Capole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſearched all parts of the houſe, but found nothing of what he ſought for, but found his traces and footings in the Garret, and thence paſſing to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage of this holy Female, he told her it was no wonder that he had heard a noiſe there before, and that there were
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58555:119"/>other Apparitions than thoſe of Spirits and Fantomes, for theſe had both Fleſh and Bones; the Window where the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was found faſtned was condemned as culpable, the Garret on all parts bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoed up as criminal, the paſſage over the Gallery ſtopped up, and all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues made inacceſſible; But it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible theſe Serpents to vomit out their poiſon which was ſo deeply fixed in their Breaſts; it was therefore time for Juſtice to give fire to her train, one ſpark being enough to blow up all, and the finding but one end of the thread ſufficient to unravel the intangled Clew: One of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi> his ſervants having been taken and bound by the Sergeants, was by them carryed to Priſon, where before the Judge that took his examination, he confeſſed but too much, manifeſting his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, by the diſcovery of his Maſters guilt: Magiſtrates who are living Laws themſelves, and interpreters onely of the dead or written ones, are moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like the Spiders, which ſeize on ſmall Flies, but let the great Waſps and Bees alone in quietneſs; ſo that of the Poet may well be applied to them:

               <p>His deſign was to impoſe ſilence on this innocent priſoner, and thereby to purchaſe the title of prudent, rather than that of juſt; and it being in his power by the means of many other witneſſes which he named to him, to prove his Adultery, and puniſh it according to Law, he was afraid to make too much noiſe about it, leaſt (like a Dog that barks too much) he ſhould be beaten for his fidelity; He knew the Grandeur and Puiſſance of <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Family, and further, that if the ſecret ſhould once come to <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s knowledge, he would ſeek Heaven and Earth for vengeance, and never ſtop at Blood or Murther. It is not, certainly without reaſon, that the wiſeſt of men hath ſaid, <hi>That a man of little courage ought not to undertake the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Magiſtrate, leaſt fearing the face of the Puiſſant, or the Power of the Mighty, he cauſe a ſcandal, or act an injuſtice by his timiditie.</hi>

               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:58555:120"/>
               <p>The Judge for fear of raiſing himſelf enemies amongſt thoſe where both the offenders and the injur'd were equally his friends, privately adviſed <hi>Alcimus,</hi> that it was beſt to withdraw his man from Priſon, through the golden gate, and lock up his lips with a key of the ſame Mettal, leaſt the ſpringing of that Mine ſhould blow him up into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This young Cavalier, unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in worldly affairs, ſlighted this advice, and thinking himſelf clearly and ſecretly eſcaped from the ſhip-wrack, was not contented wholly to deny all that had been confeſſed, but threatned his Servant with the higheſt Menaces, to make him be puniſht as a calumniatour, and laſtly, make him die by the hands of Juſtice, which made him ſtronglier perſiſt in his depoſitions, and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for witneſſes, knowing no other way to ſave his life and regain his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The Judge being no leſs friend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Family than to the perſon of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> advertiſed his Parents of it, who were already told by their own Spy of all their Proceedings, which was the cauſe that to avoid ſcandal, and leaſt that which was yet ſecret ſhould become
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58555:120"/>publick, they took him aſide, and after many grave Remonſtrances and ſerious Admonitions (notwithſtanding his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive denyal and horrible proteſtations, as if Sacriledge and Adultery could be that way purged) they gave him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how they had light on the Clew that led them in the purſuit of him through all his crooked <hi>Maeanders</hi> of wickedneſs: But this inſtead of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him made him worſe, by adding the fire of Anger to that of Luſt, ſo that his choler choaking his reaſon, put him in a fury againſt his ſervants, their honeſt care and fidelity appearing to him not onely a baſe diſobedience and diſloyalty, but an unpardonable injury: ſo true it is, that as the good change all to good, and make profit of their loſſes, the wicked turn that which is good into evil, taking ſervices for affronts, and the amity one ſtrives to ſhew them for a paſſion rather importunate and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than worthy an acknowledgment; ſo that inſtead of applying ſoft Oyls and Lenitives to this Sore, to abate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, he rather ſtrove to heighten it to a Gangrene, by threatning nothing elſe but revenge againſt his Servants, by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58555:121"/>diſcarding, blows or ſomething worſe, ſo far did his fury tranſport him againſt thoſe whoſe onely Crime was too much fidelity: And to arrive to the top of his folly, he reſolved inſtead of getting liberty for the Priſoner, to become a party againſt him, and procure his death from the hands of Juſtice, by Artifices as full of ſublety as impiety, thinking to bury his fault in the grave of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: Thus <hi>David</hi> ſtrove by the ſin of Murther to make himſelf more free and ſecret in the Commiſſion of that of Adultery.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>EE here <hi>Alcimus</hi> arrived at the very Criſis of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; And ſee how far more eaſie it is to corrupt Judges on the ſide of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, than on that of Rigour; ſince as the Lawyers ſay, That the ſoveraign ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58555:122"/>of the Law is a ſupream injury; like thoſe Remedies of Steel and Fire, which Chirurgions uſe, to diſmember and ſtop the Gangrenes of their Patients; Remedies more painful than the Diſeaſes which they cure. If <hi>Alcimus</hi> had pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſigned to free the Priſoner, and to ſmother his depoſitions, to avoid the ſtirring up a dung-hill which would fill the City with noiſome and peſtilential vapours, and by ſilence to ſave the lives and ſalve the honours of the principal offenders, there is no queſtion but the Judge had cloſed with the deſign; for as <hi>Eleazar</hi> attacqued <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in the flank, the moſt tender and onely penetrable part of this vaſt body, ſo Officers of Juſtice are ſooner van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by pity than by any other means, compaſſion being a charm whoſe ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs abates and betrayes the moſt hardy courages, but to commit an injuſtice at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with cruelty is the part of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rather than a man. This was the cauſe that <hi>Alcimus,</hi> what artifices ſoever he uſed, whether by intreaty, promiſes, or threats, to arrive unto the top of his pernicious deſign, was totally fruſtrated and deceived, and driven upon the ſame
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58555:122"/>rock on which he would have ſplit his inculpable ſervant. Being in this like the Ape, which hopping up the boughs of a Tree, the higher he climbs, the more he diſcovers his ſhame; or like the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, who the higher and more proudly he erects his plumes, the more does he diſcover the parts he ſhould ſtrive to hide. There is no ſtronger accuſation than excuſes too far ſtretch't, and too violently urged, as none are leſs believed than thoſe who think by Oaths and Blaſphemies to ſtrengthen their affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Judges alone cannot order the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, having to that end their Clerks, Proctors, Advocates and Regiſters; and the parties themſelves, who like Birds diſcover themſelves by their notes: But what was worſt of all, <hi>Capoleon</hi> proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting for Juſtice againſt him whom he thought one of the Thieves that had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to rob him, by too ſollicitouſly ſearching what he ought not, found what he would not, nor ever thought of; like an ignorant Glaſs-maker, who intending to blow a Glaſs, makes a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or a more uſeleſs and ill-ſhap'd Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: Good Heaven! how was he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58555:123"/>at the priſoner's depoſitions! a Maid gathering flowers in a Garden or Meadow for a Poeſie or a Garland, and ſuddainly ſeeing an ugly Serpent leap from under them, is not in a ſtranger diſturbance than was <hi>Capoleon</hi> at this amazing news, which (as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) was as near the truth as it was far from appearance: But as age had indued him with prudence, he, like a true <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſmother'd his reſentments, making a ſhew to the reporter, as if it were as far from his belief, as it was from truth or likelihood; But imagine in the mean time what an aſſault this was to his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſpirit: But according to the Cuſtom of the Nobility, who deſpiſe the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proceeding of Juſtice, which they will render to themſelves by furious reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; <hi>Capoleon</hi> being hereupon reſolved, though quick enough both of ſight and hearing, ſeemed to be both deaf and blind, nay more than that, inſenſible of this affront, giving out, <hi>That he would not engage his Honour upon the depoſition of a Villain, who ſtrove to ſave himſelf by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Maſter; and who like one that is a drowning, catched indifferently at all he ſaw, or what ever he thought might be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to his ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58555:123"/>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Alcimus,</hi> as if he had ſworn his own ruine (it being no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he who is once blinded ſtumbles at all that lyes in his way, and proceeds from bad to worſe) after having outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, beaten, and abuſed his Servants, turned them all out of doors; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called for Witneſſes by the priſoner, their deſpight for this injury made them eaſily conſent to tell the whole truth againſt their Maſter, which appearing by the conformity of their depoſitions, the priſoner was enlarged, and cleared of the attempt of robbing <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s houſe; and as in War there are no Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers kindlier received, than thoſe whoſe bad pay or worſe uſage forces them to change parties, their anger or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being taken and puniſh'd as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, making them doubly bold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate; ſo <hi>Capoleon,</hi> ingenious in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the original of his Evils, by fair words, and ample promiſes, drew from theſe ſhamefully injur'd Servants, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect declaration of all the moſt ſubtle and ſecret of <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Contrivances. Thus was <hi>Alcimus</hi> the Artiſan of his own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and the ruiner of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which he manifeſted by the ſame
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58555:124"/>induſtries by which he thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them, like the Hare, which declares the nearneſs of her end by her often dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Capoleon</hi> now by many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, aſſured of that which he before did but conjecture, no longer queſtioned the loſs of his Honour, and the diſloyalty of his Wife, but ſtudied how to repair it by a memorable Vengeance, which ſhould ſerve for an example to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. To this end, making no ſhew of being offended, and at the ſame time ſeeming leſs jealous than ever of <hi>Vanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and letting the Judge know (who he knew would ſoon advertiſe <hi>Alcimus</hi>) that he did not in the leaſt ſuſpect his Wifes Integrity, believing his own experience ſooner than the depoſitions of a Rogue; nor would he ever believe that ſo noble and brave a perſon as <hi>Alcimus</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize ſo unworthy an action as the robbing of his houſe, or attempting the Chaſtity of his Wife, he by this means confirmed <hi>Vannoza</hi> againſt all fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, who gave an exact accompt of all theſe paſſages to <hi>Alcimus,</hi> who on his part did the like to her of all he knew, leſt ſhe ſhould let her ſelf be betray'd to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58555:124"/>a confeſſion by furious threats or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promiſes, mingled with the falſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of <hi>Capoleon,</hi> ſo that ſtrengthening one another in their miſchievous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they imagined that they had walked in Clouds hitherto, and feared not but to find means to do ſo for the future. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poleon</hi> thus Cajoling his Wife as treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, as ſhe Careſſed him deceitfully, do by their reciprocal diſſimulation illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth of the Wiſe Man's ſaying, <hi>My Son, thoſe who flatter thee, are they that do intend to betray thee.</hi> Fraud is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſoned potion, which firſt begets a Vertigo, and then a mortal Lethargick ſlumber, which ſecurely luls us into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capoleon</hi> all this while was pitching his ſnares to entrap the prey, which ſhould make an ample ſatisfaction to his vengeance. He ſets more Spyes on work than <hi>Argus</hi> had Eyes: he gives his Wife more liberty than ever, imitating the Gaoler, who in the morning puts thoſe Priſoners into a pleaſant Garden by his Priſon, who at night muſt upon a Scaffold ſerve for a Tragique ſpectacle; or the Butchers, who gently ſtroak and claw thoſe Beaſts which they are about to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58555:125"/>knock down and kill: Thus a dead ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs precedes an Earthquake; but while our unskilful Mariners thought the ſtorm was blown over their heads, the clouds were thickening for a Tempeſt which they were ſhortly to hear ſinging through their Ears, which were now ſhut againſt whatſoever ſeemed to obſtruct their new deſigns. The difficulty of the action did the more inflame <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Paſſion, who now became the more amorous of <hi>Vannoza,</hi> the harder it was to enjoy her: The commerce with bad Women having this Similitude with Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> whoſe flames grow fiercer by the Rain which extinguiſheth others, and Scorpion-like, they can ſhoot that ſting which nothing can cure but a Medicine extracted from their own bodies. But if this fire be ſo imperious in the green Tree, what is it in the dry? I mean in the feeble ſpirit of <hi>Vannoza,</hi> whoſe flames raged ſo much the fiercer, by how much ſhe had the leſs ſtrength to reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>Theſe workers of iniquity begun again to weave a Net for their own deſtruction, for which they found no thread fitter than their old one of Father <hi>Simplicius;</hi> for <hi>Vannoza</hi> (having no other door of liberty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58555:125"/>open but that of the Church, never ſtirring out but under the pretext of Devotion, whereby ſhe found means to ſignifie her mind to her Gallant by thoſe pretended<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy characters) went preſently after this unhappy uproar to this good Father, to diſcover to him the imaginary attempt of the Robbers, in the faſhion which ſhe judged moſt proper to give a colour to her juſtification. This well-meaning Religious Father, who had taken the common report for truth, (a report as favourable to <hi>Alcimus</hi> as he could deſire for the covering of his Theft, which was of far greater concernment than what had been imagined) was much ſurprized when he heard from the mouth of <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noza,</hi> That he who fixed this ladder did it with a deſign to attack the impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fort of her Chaſtity, and that the Robber was no other than <hi>Alcimus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by his Servants, one of which being taken, had diſcovered all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign unto the Court of Juſtice, and whoſe depoſitions had been confirmed by the teſtimony of his Companions; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, renewing her Plaints againſt this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, as one whoſe often repulſes had rendred deſperate, and who by that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58555:126"/>means was come to this extremity, which was an injury for which no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhment was great enough; <hi>adding,</hi> That for all this, God had been ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto him, that <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s Heart was not thereby fill'd with any ſuſpition or rage, and that notwithſtanding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Jealouſies, which time and her Pious Endeavours had now well near effaced, he was now more inclined to hold the Servants Accuſation for falſe, than to imagine that the Maſter could admit of ſo baſe and unworthy a deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simplicius</hi> knew not what to anſwer hereunto, onely, <hi>That her ſuſpitions might be true, but yet that it was poſſible for them to be falſe, ſince Fear has the property to make us eaſily believe ill of thoſe we miſtruſt; as love makes us ever think well of thoſe we affect: but yet it was neceſſary to be well informed before we condemn, for fear of paſſing a raſh Judgment.</hi> Promiſing her withal to uſe his utmoſt endeavour to free her from this trouble, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of her frantick purſuer; and ſo comforting her the beſt he could, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt her with a bleſſing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Simplicius</hi> replyed, <hi>That he had really been of this perſwaſion, and that he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſame to the continual ſuſpitions and ordinary Complaints of</hi> Vannoza, <hi>who daily buzzed in his ears her ſuſpitions of theſe paſſages for realities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcimus,</hi> who deſired nothing more than a Perſonal Conference with this Lady, proteſted to him, <hi>That in his preſence he could bring her to confeſs that her opinion was as falſe as the contrary was true;</hi> being now perfectly cured of the impreſſions that her Beauty had ſtruck into his Soul. By this means they were ſo ſubtilly wicked as to diſcover their Minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this good Father, but in a Language
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58555:127"/>which he underſtood not; theſe being of thoſe deceitful lips which the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaks of, that ſpoke <hi>with a heart and a heart.</hi> And thus by the charitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of this Pious Man, whoſe zeal they abuſed with as much Impiety as Impudence, they both by word and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting renewed their former intercourſes, and what was more horribly wicked, in thoſe holy places, adding to the reſt the abuſe of thoſe Sacraments, which if rightly uſed are the ſeal of Salvation, but by that means the inſtruments of inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable damnation, from that Eternal God, to whom not only the Intelligences which rule the World do bow, but even the Infernal Powers tremble. O extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of hard-heartedneſs, and more than Diabolical iniquity! <hi>Capoleon,</hi> who had always his Sentinels ſet, watching the deportments of his immodeſt Wife, and the means to draw her into the ſnares he had pitched, was advertiſed of all theſe proceedings, and being informed that ſhe was often in Confeſſions with <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius,</hi> where <hi>Alcimus</hi> ſtill came as to Confeſſion, and where they had long diſcourſes together; this Man whoſe Jealouſie was even encreaſed to a frenzy,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58555:127"/>meditating nothing elſe but vengeance, took it for granted that this Father was an accomplice of his Wife's wickedneſs, his ſpirit being now open to the moſt horrible and worſt impreſſions. His ſuſpitions redoubled by the Viſits which <hi>Simplicius</hi> made to his Penitent in his houſe, to alleviate the afflictious of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which ſeemingly tormented her, even to deſpair, cauſed as well by <hi>Alcimus</hi> his deportments, as by the jealouſies of her ſuſpitious Husband; all which were but ſo many inventions to cloak her ſublime ſubtlety. Theſe well-meaning Viſits of <hi>Simplicius</hi> in <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s houſe were not without ſome ſhort remonſtrances to the Old man; not lightly to believe the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Town, the reports of Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys and ſuch looſe kind of people, whoſe only deſign was to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flattery, at the expence of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's reputation, and to work their own credit by the defamation of the moſt virtuous perſons. This added ſtrength to his Jealouſie, and ſuſpition of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> whom he hereby concluded to be one of the parties, and thereby wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be included in their puniſhment. And thus by a miſ-intelligence of what

It is hard to judge whether it be more proper to call this ſervant <hi>Treacherous</hi> or <hi>Faithful;</hi> for if ſhe was perfidious to her diſloyal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, ſhe was faithful to her Maſter, who had paid and appointed her to watch his honour: To ſpeak more properly, let us term her a female, and caſt upon her Sex the fault of incapacity of guarding a Secret, rather than to accuſe her of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, ſince (as is to be ſuppoſed) making
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58555:130"/>a profeſſion of honeſty, beſides incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſhe further imitated the Sea, which will not harbour a dead Carcaſs or Carrion, (unleſs kept down by a Weight) but vomiteth it out upon her Shoars; A Secret in Woman being like new Wine, which purgeth its ſelf, and works out at the mouth of the Veſſel.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58555:130"/>her Miſtreſs, holding in ſeemingly with her and her Lover, but really with <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> ſhe on all hands reaped a Golden Harveſt: The other, (whom we will call <hi>Liſarda</hi>) whether it were that ſhe naturally abhorr'd ſuch double dealing, or whether ſhe feared that her report (as ſeemingly it would) ſhould be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood and miſchief; or were it that ſhe took compaſſion of her Miſtreſs, having a horrour of deceiving her who had ſo freely imparted a Secret to her, which imported no leſs than her life; or were it (which is moſt likely) that the ſtrongeſt Adamant attracted this Iron, and that the double recompences of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi> and <hi>Vannoza</hi> joyned to the gale of promiſes which filled the Sail of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, out-weighed the ſparing Salaries of this penurious Old Man; Which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of all theſe was the Motive, ſhe wholly quitted <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s Party for the other of her Miſtreſſes, and firmly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued her ſelf amongſt all her Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes: But yet ſhe acting with more fear and miſtruſt of <hi>Capoleon</hi> than her Compaſſion did, ſhe ſaw (not without Envy, the ordinary diſeaſe of feeble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) her ſelf leſs intruſted and imploved

               <p>
                  <hi>Capoleon</hi> advertiſed by <hi>Adriana</hi> of all their wickedneſs and mockeries, kept his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58555:131"/>patience, that like Vulcan he might take them at his eaſe, and have his turn to laugh at their Tragical ſucceſs: Imagine but what flegme the enraged <hi>Capoleon</hi> muſt have to qualifie ſo much choler, and how dexterouſly he retired to make a greater leap, and deferr'd his vengeance to execute it the more ſeverely; all the Letters which paſſed through <hi>Adriana</hi>'s hands were communicated to him, by which he underſtood all the motions of this unhappy Cabal: Oft-times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with rage and fury, he was on the point of breaking out into a bloody exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; but whether he thought the fruit not yet ripe enough, whether he were not ſufficiently aſſured of his men who were to aſſiſt him in the action; whether God (the hour of Chaſtiſement of theſe execrable offenders being not yet come) withheld the arm of this Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of his Juſtice, by moderating the Motions of his heart to attend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the Criminals: or whether, after the Mode of that Nation, he ſtaid for an opportunity to envelope in one common ruine all thoſe whom he thought Accomplices in this fact: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were, he was reſtrained by ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58555:132"/>ſecret cauſe; till one day (the meaſure of the ſins of theſe Sacrilegious Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers being now arrived to the height) after having provided himſelf of all things neceſſary, both of Men and Arms, he pretended to take a Journey about an Important Affair which he had at a Town three days Journey from home. Now conſider by what follows, whether it were not high time for <hi>Capoleon</hi> to come to a concluſion, ſeeing the extream mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and laſt point of Villany to which theſe two Criminals were now arrived; for as it is common with Adulterers, and eſpecially thoſe who have Sacriledge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, to draw on Homicides in the train of their other vices, <hi>Alcimus</hi> and <hi>Vanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> earneſt of an unconſtrained recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal enjoyment, were come to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ridding themſelves of the Old Man, either by Sword to Poiſon, to plain their way to a future Marriage. This Journey was laid hold on by <hi>Vannoza,</hi> as a ſit occaſion to perpetrate the Murther by Bravo's (ſo they call the <hi>Italian</hi> Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins) in ſome Wood or narrow paſſage, under colour of Robbery. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel broached firſt by <hi>Vannoza,</hi> was readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced by her <hi>Adonis,</hi> who for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58555:132"/>Money failed not of Men who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to execute this Bloody Enterprize: <hi>Vannoza</hi> had divers times attempted the courage of her Maid, to ſlip ſome poyſon into <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s Meat or Wine, but <hi>Liſarda</hi> loth to envelope her ſelf in ſo deſperate a deſign; <hi>Adriana</hi> however more ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly compliant, preſently gave her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter warning to avoid this intended miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>But now this Aſſaſſinate being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, broke off the other more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſign of poyſoning, but (as if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy were incompatible to that Sex) <hi>Vannoza</hi> reveal'd it to <hi>Adriana,</hi> praiſing it for an Heroick Action, and ſinging Songs of Triumph before the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capoleon</hi> making preparation for his pretended Journey, <hi>Adriana</hi> amazedly came running to diſſwade him from it, revealing the Conſpiracy that was made againſt him; to whom the crafty Old Man to diſſipate her Fears, anſwered her, <hi>That he would countermine them, and by taking the takers, marr all their Plots:</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging her to be faithful to him; and ſo thanking her for her advice, he diſmiſt her.</p>
               <p>He had already cauſed all the Keys of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58555:133"/>his houſe to be counterfeited, to enter at what times he pleaſed, to take the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals in the act: Whereupon he ſet forwards in good equipage, and well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, having under-hand given order that all his Wifes actions ſhould be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently watched, leaving one in truſt to learn of <hi>Adriana</hi> the news of her deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: He had ſo long given <hi>Vannoza</hi> her ſwing, that he now ſeemed to be no longer jealous. His Journey was ſo well coloured, that there was no ſubject left to ſuſpect it; He was followed three or four miles by a Servant of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> to ſee what way he took: At the place where he Dined he remained until night, and returned to the Town very late; where being retired to a private houſe, he heard from <hi>Adriana</hi> that his back was hardly turned when <hi>Alcimus</hi> came to ſupply his place in the habit of a Jeweller.</p>
               <p>The Night was in the middle of its courſe, and darkneſs more then Cimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian had over-ſpread the ſurface of the Earth, and the ſweetneſs of reſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of ſleep had rendred the Condition of moſt in the City little different in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance from that of the dead; when <hi>Capoleon,</hi> whoſe many deſigns and

What caſe <hi>Vannoza</hi> was in when thus ſuddainly awaked, I leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to imagine, hearing the eager and angry ſound of her Husband's voice, who thus ſurprized her betwixt the Arms of a man, who together with her had not

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58555:135"/>Looking-Glaſſes Powders, Perfumes, and ſuch like toys which <hi>Vannoza</hi> had uſed either to augment her Beauty, or repair its defaults; theſe had been the ſparks that had help'd to raiſe ſuch a flame in this young man's Soul; but now thoſe Odours only could ſerve to help to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm his Body: For notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance he could make, <hi>Capoleon</hi> and his followers ſoon entred into the Chamber, and ſeeing <hi>Vannoza</hi> diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Fall, and knowing from <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> that <hi>Alcimus</hi> was ſhut into the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, the door was quickly forced open, and the young Cavalier being only in his ſhirt, ſoon found himſelf pierced in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of his Body, and conſtrain'd to yield unto the mercy of his Enemy; who, like the cruel <hi>Tiberius,</hi> would not ſpeed him too ſuddainly, leaſt he ſhould thereby deprive himſelf of the pleaſure of Revenge, and therefore would ſtretch his Torments by the prolongation of his Life; He dragg'd him into the Chamber, and threw him on the Bed, which he ſo lately had unhappily polluted, to uſe him as they do thoſe Robbers, whom they execute upon the place where they acted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58555:136"/>their Villanies: Fear ſo ſeized on <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> that ſhe run to hide herſelf, though ſhe had no cauſe to fear for that for which ſhe expected a Reward: <hi>Liſarda</hi> cried out Murther, deſpairing of her Life, but was laid hold on all undreſt by <hi>Capoleon,</hi> who ſacrific'd her to his fury before <hi>Alcimus</hi> his face, charging her with as many ſtabs as injurious words, letting out her Soul and Blood together upon the ſpot: <hi>Alcimus</hi> then might ſee before his eyes the cruelties and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they prepared for him to ſuffer, the report of which ſtrikes a trembling and horrour into me, like one who looks on affrightful wounds. <hi>Capoleon</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his revenge, he ſent a Meſſenger ſpeedily to the Monaſtery where <hi>Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> reſided, to beſeech him to come to his Wife, who was upon the point of death by a Catarre, but deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs her ſelf to him before ſhe expired: This good Father aroſe with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed, preſſed forwards by a Holy Charity, which cauſes a ſlighting and neglect of reſt to run to the ſuccour of Souls and ſervice of our Neighbour, principally in ſuch urgent occaſions of

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58555:137"/>cruel as my wickedneſs deſerves; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew not your hands in the blood of the juſt, which God will be ſure to require at your hands, and exact from you a rigorous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of. It is I alone have ſinned, and deceived and abus'd him; and if you pleaſe to give me but one moments audience, I will tell you in ſhort the truth of the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; I am going to dye, and neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or deſire pardon from God, if I lye or uſe any diſguiſement of the truth.</hi> Then taking <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s ſilence for conſent, he laid open, as well as his throbs and pangs would ſuffer him, that which we have recounted of <hi>Vannoza</hi>'s Artifices and his own, to defile the bed and betray the honour of <hi>Capoleon:</hi> adding thereunto many other particularities, (moſt of which we have already recited) but with what brevity he could, his condition not admitting of a long diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>He made this publick and ſolemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with ſo much repentance and contrition, that his heart ſeemed to cleave aſunder with ſighs, which broke out as faſt as the blood guſhed from his mouth, and his eyes boyling over with tears as faſt as the blood bubbled from his gaſtly Wounds: How many pardons did he beg
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58555:138"/>of God, and of <hi>Capoleon,</hi> deteſting his faults, and abhorring his iniquities. O how many Lives could he have deſired, that he might expiate his crimes by as many deaths! animating <hi>Capoleon</hi> to take all the revenges of him he could deſire, by the longeſt and moſt exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he could invent: He abſolutely cleared <hi>Simplicius</hi> of the Crime, and made his Innocence unqueſtionably apparent; which made <hi>Capoleon</hi> ſee the injuſtice of his Cruelty to him; who thereupon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Wounds to be bound up, and in the next place ſent to know certainly the condition of his Wife; which vex'd him to the Soul when he was aſſured that her death had mock'd his Cruelty, and robb'd him of a more ſevere revenge. Before <hi>Simplicius</hi> was retired from this Bloody Spectacle, <hi>Alcimus</hi> making the ſtrongeſt of his weak efforts, rouled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the ground, and ſo proſtrate begged of <hi>Capoleon,</hi> who held his Swords point bent againſt his Throat, <hi>To have pity of his Soul, though not of his Body, and to content himſelf with his Temporal death, and not ſtretch his hatred to Eternity, but to permit him to receive Abſolution from</hi> Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius <hi>his hands:</hi> Which the Cruel <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58555:138"/>would have denyed him, (ſo far did his rage tranſport him) had not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured <hi>Simplicius</hi> prevented him, by ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and in this laſt extremity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him give the beſt teſtimony he could of his Contrition; and thereupon giving him his loſt <hi>Viaticum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words which <hi>Alcimus</hi> ſpake to him, ſeeing him depart, and leave him as a prey to his inhumane Enemy, were ſufficient to breed Pity in the inſenſible Rocks, or in the Waves themſelves, which all hold inexorable; but this bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger growing ſtill more furious at this Mournful Muſick, conſulted with his Affiſtants which environed him, in what manner they ſhould torment him, to make his death more ſenſibly painful; He commanded a fire to be lighted, to burn him by degrees, and laying him in the heat of the flames, had not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to let the Element (though mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs enough) have the ſole management of his vengeance, he therefore begun with him as the Crow does with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, by firſt barbarouſly digging out his Eyes; and in the next place with his Sword made him an Eunuch; (for that is the modeſteſt name I can put upon ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58555:139"/>vile an action) He then cut off the tips of his Fingers and Toes, and after that his Noſe, Lips, and Ears, all which the poor Patient ſuffered with a Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy that ſurmounted all imagination, continually invoking the holy Name of Jeſus, from whom alone he expected Salvation.</p>
               <p>His cruel Tormentor continuing his Revenge, pierced his Legs, Arms and Sides in many places, and then applyed burning Torches to the Wounds; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſoften the Cruelty of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Old man; his very Attendants, people void of humanity, could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger endure the ſight of this Barbarity, but conjured him to give him the Stab of grace, that is to ſay, to pierce his heart, and diſpatch and free him from his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; otherwiſe that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to do him that miſerable courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: At laſt when this wretched body opened in ſo many places, and caſting out blood on all ſides, remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pulſe or motion, and was ready to breathe out the laſt ſigh of its expiring breath, with a faint and languiſhing voice, making his laſt invocation of mercy from his Redeemer, <hi>Capoleon</hi> then fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58555:139"/>that he had eſcaped his cruelty, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ript up his Breaſt, ſnatch'd out his Heart and threw it in his face, as they do in <hi>England</hi> with their Traytors. And thus expired the unhappy <hi>Alcimus,</hi> drawn like an Ox to the ſlaughter by a wicked Woman, (to uſe the Wiſe Man's ſaying) having ſcarce body enough to contain the Wounds which the Old Man made there; who would laſtly have thrown his mangled Body into the fire, had he not been reſtrained by a deſire to expoſe to the Peoples view theſe Three Bodies which he had ſacrificed to his rage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simplicius</hi> having ſeen the bruiſed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Vannoza,</hi> filled with horrour and aſtoniſhment, to avoid further danger of injuries and abuſes, fled as ſpeedily as he could with his Companion to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to ſecure themſelves, and to look after the cure of his Wounds: The alarm was there in an inſtant taken, and from thence ecchoed through the City: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora</hi> had ſcarce begun to peep out of her obſcure bed, but ſeized with horrour at at the ſight of ſo much blood which ſpurted in her face as ſhe peep'd into the Chamber, ſhe would willingly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her lodging, being almoſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58555:140"/>afraid to diſcover to the approaching Sun ſo Bloody and ſo Tragical a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle: Finally, the day beginning to diſcover the colour of things, the Street was fill'd with people, <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s Door was beſieged by the Crowd, every one flocking to know what had paſſed: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poleon</hi> bold and hardy as a right Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and one that knew the Laws and Juſtice, by the Cuſtome of that City, bended towards his ſide, fearleſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the arrival of the Officers, to whoſe Eyes he expoſed thoſe Maſſacred bodies, which he with fire and Sword had ſo inhumanly mangled. If his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were accuſed by ſome, his cruelty was as much condemned by others, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one judging of the action according to their divers ſentiments; but he having brought evident proofs of the adultery and Sacriledge of <hi>Alcimus</hi> and his Wife, and the treachery of his Maid <hi>Liſarda,</hi> who had been confederate in their crime, the Murthered remained dead without poſſibility of being revenged, and <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> free without fear of puniſhment, having onely anticipated the reward of their Crimes, and prevented the hand of Juſtice: But becauſe that in the City where this Tragick Adventure happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58555:140"/>the Eccleſiaſtick bear a great ſway, the Wounds of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy uſage of the Religious Brother that accompanied him, cauſed him to be confined to his houſe, till there were a better information made of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>This good and truly Religious Father reſolved to preſerve his wonted Patience, and readineſs to pardon Offences, and therefore formed no Proceſs againſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poleon;</hi> but contrarily excuſed him all he could, alledging the ſtrong ſuſpition he had of him, till cleared by <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Confeſſion: Notwithſtanding which, thoſe Miniſters of Juſtice though they abſolved <hi>Capoleon</hi> of the principal Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet were reſolved to proſecute him to the utmoſt for this inconſiderate Wounding of <hi>Simplicius;</hi> And though <hi>Simplicius</hi> cryed out, <hi>That he required no further ſatisfaction for his wrongs,</hi> yet the Fiſcal leaving his particular Concern, undertook the Publick one of the whole Church, which was abus'd and wronged in this injury of one of its Members, who was not ſo much troubled at his unjuſt Wounding, as that they ſhould envy him the glory of Martyrdome, being
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58555:141"/>willing to ſuffer far more than he had hitherto done in the cauſe of Piety and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>This Alarm rouzed up <hi>Capoleon,</hi> who thereupon thought it moſt convenient and healthful to go take a little Country-Air, hoping to find more ſecurity in a ſuddain flight, than in a dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and make his Accord the beſt at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time the Town was in a Commotion and an Uproar; for the Parents of <hi>Alcimus</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Vannoza</hi> were reſolved not to put up ſo irrepair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wrongs, as were the inhumane but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of their Children, but were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bathe their injuries, and waſh off the diſgrace of their Families in the blood of the Cruel <hi>Capoleon;</hi> a Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe. This makes me admire the frailty of humane Nature, which by an extream blindneſs in the execution of its diſordinate paſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from bad to worſe; As if the death of <hi>Capoleon</hi> could render <hi>Alcimus</hi> and <hi>Vannoza</hi> leſs Sacrilegious or Adulterous; and as if by this Homicide they could efface irreparable Infamy with which their Family was ſullied and diſgraced.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58555:141"/>See here the paths and ways of revenge, which the blind actors account a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reparation for the outrages they would puniſh. <hi>Vannoza</hi>'s Parents with Money hire and ſet into the Field many Bravo's to ſearch out <hi>Capoleon</hi> in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Sea and Land, and to cut him in pieces in what place ſoever they ſhould find him, and in the mean time they were ſo tranſported with fury, that they made his City Houſe be fired, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtately one which he had in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> ſeeing the Channel and Fountain ſtopp'd up by the death of their onely Son, which ſhould have tranſmitted their names unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and they deprived of an Heir to their large Revenues, they reſolved to acquire one, and at the ſame time to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their revenge, an appetite more dear and ſweet unto them, than life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>They had ſacrificed to a Cloyſter, partly by force, and partly by conſent, but however, involuntarily (ſince the Will preſuppoſeth a free and ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous determination, without inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or conſtraint) a Daughter which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58555:142"/>Heaven had beſtow'd on them, becauſe they thought her not fair enough, nor of a ready Wit, or accompliſhments fit for a ſecular life: And thus this poor Innocent had been dragg'd unto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar like a Victim, not without many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of her reluctancy and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but ſuch as appeared ſo little through the ſmotherings of her impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Parents, that it no whit hindred her from being firſt habited, and then profeſs'd a Nun: They ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without a male-Child, began to caſt their eyes upon this Female one, and perſwaded themſelves that they might declare her vows void, as having been violently extorted; They hoped by her to raiſe up living Pillars to ſupport their names, and to ſtrike a ſpark which might again light up the extinguiſh't Torch of their poſterity: In order to this deſign, they choſe for their Son-in-Law a young Gentleman, poor in the Goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but rich in thoſe of the Mind as well as Nobility, being of excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments both of Soul and Body, from him they promiſed themſelves all ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, obedience, and ſervice: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deſire of revenge was predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58555:142"/>in their breaſts above that of linage, they would have him enter through this Gate into their alliance, a Gate of blood, from which no good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs could be expected.</p>
               <p>This young Gentleman's name was <hi>Lucio,</hi> who ſeeing himſelf accoſted with ſo advantageous a Propoſal, as that of eſpouſing <hi>Polixena</hi> (for ſo they called <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Cloyſter'd Siſter) a rich Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, which with a little expence might be withdrawn from the Convent, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſie to prove that ſhe was forced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt her will, he preſently cloſed with them in all their Propoſitions, it being a fortune far ſurmounting all that he could hope for; he neither enquired after the Beauty nor Breeding of the Damſel, nor deſired either to ſee or ſpeak to her, but willingly purchaſed this Merchandize without ever opening it; ſo far was he dazzled with the ſparkling of her Riches, and the ſplendour of her Family.</p>
               <p>He conſented that the firſt Child pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from this Marriage, ſhould bear the Name and Arms of the Houſe of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus,</hi> which he took for as great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58555:143"/>to himſelf, as ſatisfaction to them. Finally, this young Cavalier would have bought this <hi>Michol</hi> at the price of an hundred heads of <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> ſo that they had no ſooner propoſed to him the price to be the life of <hi>Capoleon,</hi> but he took them at their word, and ſtruck up the bargain, promiſing to take away the head of this <hi>Goliah,</hi> were he ſtronger than a Gyant, and higher than a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

               <p>The fire that had ſeized on this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins heart, did in a ſhort time make an incredible progreſs, being ſeized with impatience to be delivered from her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and diſ-intangled from her bonds, by a Diſpenſation, which they found more difficult to obtain than they at firſt imagined: Affairs at <hi>Rome</hi> have lead hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their feet, as well as moſt of the Acts of Grace have at their Labels: Adding

               <p>Whilſt they are making this purſuit, <hi>Lucio</hi> reſolves to execute the vengeance he was intruſted with, and render it ſo memorable, that he ſhould thereby ſeem to merit the good fortune offer'd him.

                  <hi>Lucio</hi> leaving the Body pierced, hack'd, and torn in a thouſand places, carried his Head and Heart to <hi>Alcimus</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who exerciſed upon them all that their rage and fury ſhould ſuggeſt; The Mother, like a Savage Fury, planted her Teeth in the Heart, and tore the Eyes out of the Head, and mangling the reſt, threw it to the Dogs to be devoured: But who can imagine the multitude of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, with which they entertained their intended Son-in-Law, as if by this man's death he had given them life. Their Paſſion being ſatiated with revenge, they could not content themſelves with their private ſatisfaction, but publiſh it, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58555:146"/>(which is worſe) glory in it, praiſing the Murtherer, as having done a moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, and bleſſing him with their greateſt approbation; in which they were ſeconded by <hi>Vannoza</hi>'s Parents, who boaſted of their having procured the burning of <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s Houſes. Thus the wicked rejoyce in their Iniquity, and glory in their own confuſion.</p>
               <p>But now their Diſtemper increaſed from a burning Feaver to a raging Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, for <hi>Polixena</hi>'s Parents were not able to procure a Diſpenſation for their Daughter, becauſe they could not prove the violence done unto her, by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction that had been on her part, and much leſs to obtain an abolition of <hi>Lucio</hi>'s Crime, who was ſtrictly proſecuted by <hi>Capoleon</hi>'s Heirs, (more diſcreet than the others in their revenge) but were far more aſtoniſh'd, when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves attacqued as the Authors and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices of ſo horrid an Aſſaſſinate; it was now neceſſary for the Parents both of <hi>Alcimus</hi> and <hi>Vannoza,</hi> to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the beſt they could, and to provide for the ſecurity of their lives by a ſpeedy flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucio,</hi> who expected nought but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58555:147"/>for his Victory, was conſtrain'd to ſlip aſide, to avoid the violence of the purſuit, which would have forced him to change his Nuptial Bed for a Scaffold. Soon after their flight they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Contumacie, and all their Goods being Confiſcate, their Effigies ſerved for a ſhameful Spectacle in the Publique place of Execution of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>See here the Infamies and Calamities, to which they blindly precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who will by Vengeance repair their Honour, and thereby wound that of the Prince, and intrench upon the power of their Sovereign; this is to ſnatch the Sword from the hand of him who bears it not in vain, but for the publick puniſhment of the wicked, and the defence of the good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucio</hi> like the Dog in the Fable, loſt the ſubſtance for the ſhadow, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more, robb'd himſelf of the little that he had; the loſs of his Goods by Confiſcation, and his baniſhment from his native Countrey, were the leaſt of his pains; for had he been taken, he had been cut in quarters, the horrour of his Crime meriting no leſs a puniſhment, if

               <p>But to give to this Bloody Relation a Cataſtrophe, which in its Tragical event affords ſomething as divertiſing as ſtrange, we are to know, That the ruine of <hi>Polixena</hi>'s Family and Parents could not extinguiſh the waſting flames which the hope of being married to, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Lucio,</hi> had kindled within her; habituated Paſſions are not ſo ſoon put off as our Habits: This Maid had no Ears to hear the impoſſibility of obtaining a Diſpenſation, ſhe had ſo long perſwaded her ſelf that nothing was more certain, but much leſs to hear of the flight of her Parents, and of the Confiſcation of their Goods, which were the only things that rendred her acceptable: She at firſt thought all this but feigned, and eaſie to be impoſed upon a Cloiſter'd perſon, but ſoon after fell into a matchleſs Frenzy, and a diſconſolate deſpair, beyond the advice or comfort of any.

               <p>Prophane Writings are Vermine which creep into the moſt Sacred places through the curioſity of the Inhabitants; And though they are apt to corrupt good Manners, and alter the chaſteſt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet it cannot be prevented, but that the moſt retired Veſtals will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caſt an eye upon their diverting pages, where learning that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew not; or refreſhing their Memory of that which a long diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance had made them bury in oblivion, they either beget or awake in them the Idea's of a thouſand Inquietudes; This
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58555:149"/>puts me in mind of the <hi>Roman Veſtal,</hi> who having read in a Poet that which had ſtirr'd in her a criminal paſſion, one day raviſh'd by the force of Imagination, ſhe unwittingly cry'd out,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Kill me, if Love ben't a delicious thing,</hi>

                        <hi>And Marriage do not matchleſs pleaſures bring.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> Which ſo ſcandalized thoſe that heard her, that ſhe was by them brought before the Cenſour, there to be chaſtized, as one that had broken the Integrity which ſhe ought to preſerve under pain of death. And that which is remarkable, is, That Perjury was forbidden amongſt them with the ſame rigour as Diſhoneſty. The Cenſour upon this Accuſation adjudged her to be buried alive, the common pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of thoſe who had violated the Chaſtity which they had vow'd to <hi>Veſta.</hi> This <hi>Veſtal</hi> proteſting that ſhe was a Virgin, and that her Body was pure from the corruptions of pleaſure; The Judge who condemned her for her words, did by the ſame convince her, ſaying to her, <hi>Either thou haſt experimented unlawful pleaſures, which make thee culpable; Or if
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58555:149"/>thou haſt not, thy Perjury makes thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve death, by affirming that which thou art ignorant of.</hi> This <hi>Dilemma</hi> ſtopt her mouth, and the rigorous Sentence was executed upon her. Certainly we live under a Law, ſo much more exact, as it is incomparably more pure, more true, more juſt, than that of the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> benighted with the thick Fogs and clouds of Paganiſm: For the Spouſe of holy Virgins is ſo delicate, that he is not onely jealous of the purity of their bodies, but even of that of their thoughts; ſo that to ſee him and be happy, they muſt be pure in heart: Whatſoever then may in the leaſt ſully this lovely white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ought to be as carefully avoided, as the Ermin ſhuns what may defile her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Furre: Let tender Virgins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, avoid as Rocks and Shelves theſe impure Books, ſince under their words of honey, and flouriſhing expreſſions, are hid the Serpents of dangerous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The Monaſtery wherein <hi>Polixena</hi> was incloſed, was of great Eminency, and full of Cloyſter'd Virgins, but whether ſo lively as they ought, I know not: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were, this Maid was pleaſed with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58555:150"/>the reading of fooliſh and fabulous Books, ſuch as are Poetry and Romances. Amongſt the Images of Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there often ſlide into the holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces licentious Pictures, which alſo make unhandſome impreſſions in weak and tender ſpirits, though they be onely there under the pretext of Hangings and Imbroideries, whence it happens that ſomethings the moſt fabulous and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, oft paſs for truths in their belief, and take place of more ſolid Idea's: This happen'd to <hi>Polixena,</hi> who reading of the imaginary artifice of <hi>Dedalus</hi> his wings, by which he eſcaped the <hi>Cretan</hi> Priſon, and oft fixing her eyes upon a Picture repreſented this Fable, and having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in Hangings wrought it with her Needle, with which ſhe had made curious Wings which balanced the father and his ſon <hi>Icarus</hi> in the Air, this ſtory wrought ſo upon her melancholy and diſtracted fancy, that ſhe would try to imitate the cunning of the one, without remembring the folly and misfortune of the other.</p>
               <p>She heaped together from all parts as many feathers as ſhe could, and bought abundance, beſides many intire Birds,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58555:150"/>whoſe feathers pleaſed her as much as their fleſh did others; with theſe ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make Chaplets and Garlands, and ſuch like pretty toys, in which thoſe of her Sex and condition are for the moſt part incomparably ingenious: They let her alone, hoping it might divert her Melancholy. She made a large habit, of Feathers artificially wrought upon a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Robe fitted to her body, and then faſhioned two large Wings, with which by the moving of her Arms ſhe thought ſhe could bear up her ſelf in the Air, and if need were, fly with this brave accoutrement even into another World. Her deſign was to go find her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in what part of the World ſoever they abode; and if they conſented not to marry her to <hi>Lucio,</hi> to fly to him, and ſummon him to perform his promiſe; which was to reverſe the Fable of <hi>Leda,</hi> who was coupled with a Swan. See here the extravagant vanity of a ſpirit tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with Love, and then tell me whether the blind deity which preſides over this paſſion have not wings: But it was not enough to put on theſe toys without ſhe uſe them; having therefore one Evening fitted up all her fair fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58555:151"/>attire, and paſſed all the Night in an unſpeakable extravagancy, in which ſhe made as many rounds about the World as <hi>Job</hi>'s malicious Wanderer, and not having been able to cloſe her eyes, it was eaſie for her to riſe ſooner in the Morning than any of the reſt. Being therefore mounted upon the Steeple, and having fitted on her Habit in which ſhe thought to out-flye the Eagle, and feared nothing but being born up too high and too near the Sun, ſhe caſt her ſelf with extended Arms from her lofty ſtation: But never Hawk ſtruck down ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his Prey, as ſhe precipitated her ſelf to the ground, where ſhe was cruſh't almoſt into as many pieces as ſhe had feathers on her Habit.</p>
               <p>Morning being come, ſhe who had charge to ring the Bell, paſſing through the Cloiſters, was ready to ſink down with fear, ſeeing this Bird ſtretch't out at length, of a greater bulk by far than ſhe had ever ſeen before; fear put wings to her feet, if not greater, yet however ſwifter than thoſe which the Miſerable <hi>Polixena</hi> had fixed to her Arms. This Maid was her ſelf the Bell that ſuddainly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58555:151"/>ſounded up all the Convent: The trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Doves beheld this affrightful Eagle through the Windows of their Cells, and could almoſt have crept into the crannies of the Walls to hide themſelves from ſo terrible a Creature, of which they had never ſeen nor heard the like: Some took it for a <hi>Dragon;</hi> others for a <hi>Griffon,</hi> and all for that which their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural puſillanimity dictated unto them: At laſt having taken ſomewhat better courage, and fortified themſelves with the Croſs and Holy-Water, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the breathleſs Corps of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixena,</hi> ſo battered and bruiſed, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally her head, that it was hard to know her. At laſt they underſtood the folly, and to what deſign ſhe had amaſsed ſo many Feathers, and her Companions calling to mind her ordinary diſcourſes about <hi>Dedalus</hi> and <hi>Icarus,</hi> and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be turn'd into a Bird, and many other her extravagancies, conjectured it to be as we have ſaid; and it was as ſoon divulged through the City, the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Event ſerving a long time for diſcourſe and entertainment. Some pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied her, others laughed at her; and as there are as many different Minds in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58555:152"/>World as men, every one judged of it according to their fancy: The wiſer ſort blamed her Parents, who had rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned then vowed her to God, who accepts none but voluntary ſacrifices. Her folly however ſomewhat excuſed her deſpair, being overcome by an enraged paſſion which had in others upon like occaſion produced more tragical, though none ſo ridiculous events.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all with a ſhort Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which at that time was that of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> who as on the top of a rock, mounted high above the reach of the fierceſt waves, from thence beheld all theſe furious tempeſts of a diſturbed Sea, and conſidering how fearfully the hand of God darts lighting upon the heads of the incorrigibly impious, after the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcanning of all the particulars we have before related, he ſhut up his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, as we ſhall do our Diſcourſe, with theſe words of the Divine Singer,
